> "Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing. Such are the differences among human beings in their sources of pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable."

I am committed to providing excellent and accessible learning experiences for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2021, I earned a [Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/certificate-program/) from UC Berkeley. In 2017, I received the *Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award* for my instruction in undergraduate quantitative methods and research design. Given to fewer than ten percent of graduate student instructors, the award recognized the quality of my teaching even in my first semester in the classroom.

My pedagogical approach combines liberal arts–style broad intellectual foundations with design school–style hands-on experiences. My strength as an instructor comes from interdisciplinary training and extensive applied experience. My objective is to help students build strong intellectual foundations while simultaneously developing the habits of mind that allow them to tackle new problems. Guided by these principles, my teaching in public policy and data science emphasizes engagement with big ideas and cutting-edge scholarship, alongside sustained attention to practical applications and ethical implications.


**Current Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)**

* **The Politics of Public Policy** \[[course website](https://jaeyk.github.io/politics_of_public_policy/)\]

This course begins from the premise that power and politics are central to policy innovation, since innovation disrupts the status quo. Drawing on research in American politics, comparative politics, and public administration, it examines how institutions, organizations, and groups shape policy delivery, and why that process is inherently political. Students will engage with frameworks that explain how people experience government on the ground, and how those experiences both reflect and reshape political coalitions, power structures, and institutional arrangements. The course equips students to design policy innovations that reduce barriers to access and to scale those innovations across programs and agencies.

<summary><strong>Potential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)</strong></summary>

The following three courses form an integrated sequence in public policy data science, grounded in a **domain-first** approach. Rather than treating data science as a purely technical endeavor, the sequence begins with the policy problems themselves—emphasizing how data, computation, and artificial intelligence can be used *in context* to advance the public good. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance—from **algorithmic decision-making** to **digital service delivery** and **researcher-practitioner collaboration**. Together, they prepare students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data and AI in the policy process, equipping them with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled solutions to public problems.

- **Data, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy**  

This course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and AI systems are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. The topics span multiple stages of governance, from lawmaking and adjudication to implementation, mainly in the U.S. with comparative perspectives. Particular attention is given to the challenges of balancing efficiency gains (promised by algorithmic systems) with the protection of public values in machine-mediated decision-making embedded in existing institutional and organizational contexts. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems in ways that advance public values and align with the goals and constraints of public governance.

- **Civic Tech and Digital Public Service**  

This course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI agents in shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to incorporate the lived experiences of people who rely on government services and are often underserved by them.

- **Evidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact**

This course examines how data scientists (or evaluators) can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses, and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative process and use of evidence for public impact.
