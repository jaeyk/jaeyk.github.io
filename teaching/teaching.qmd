### Scheduled Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)

**The Politics of Public Policy**  

Public policy does not end with the passage of legislation. While policy design often attracts the most attention, the implementation phase—where political decisions are translated into administrative action—frequently unfolds in relative silence. This course seeks to unveil that curtain. It examines how power, institutions, and political behavior shape the ways policies are interpreted, delivered, and experienced in practice.

  Students analyze three interrelated dimensions of policy implementation:  

  - **Institutional structures**, including federalism, separation of powers, and administrative procedures 
  - **Political behavior**, such as public opinion and media frames  
  - **Organizational influences**, including bureaucratic discretion, frontline decision-making, and administrative capacity  

  The course also explores how policies generate *feedback effects*—altering patterns of political participation, reinforcing or challenging institutional arrangements, and shaping future implementation practices.

  The course adapts to different levels of study:  
  
  - For **undergraduates**, it introduces key concepts and real-world cases that reveal the political significance of implementation.  
  - For **Master of Public Policy (MPP) students**, it emphasizes applied analysis and equips students with conceptual tools to assess and navigate implementation challenges.  
  - For **PhD students**, the course engages with theoretical and empirical literature on policy feedback, institutional development, and street-level governance. Doctoral students are expected to develop original research questions and contribute to scholarly debates on the politics of implementation.

### Potential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)

These three courses form an integrated sequence in **public policy data science**, preparing students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data, computation, and artificial intelligence in the policy process. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance—from causal inference and algorithmic decision-making to digital service delivery and practitioner collaboration. Together, they equip students with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data- and AI-driven solutions to public problems.

- **Data, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy**  

This course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and machine learning models are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. Particular attention is given to the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including issues of opacity, bias, and institutional accountability. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with the goals and constraints of public governance.

- **Civic Tech and Digital Public Service**  

This course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms—such as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI-powered tools—in shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery, including transparency, user autonomy, and algorithmic accountability. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to enhance—not replace—human judgment, trust, and inclusion in public programs.

- **Evidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact**

This course examines how data scientists and policy researchers can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses—including field experiments and operational evaluations—and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative production and use of evidence for public impact.
