title: "Teaching and advising"

My teaching style is effective because it combines my academic expertise with professional experience. I am an award-winning certified instructor and have taught computational social science in semester-long courses and short workshops. In addition, I have co-authored two articles published in PS: Political Science & Politics on computational social science pedagogy and training. I also wrote an open-access textbook for computational methods titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/comp_thinking_social_science/)

1.  ["Teaching Computational Social Science for All."](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/teaching-computational-social-science-for-all/66EAB886BCF21C647E2387051D6A9BEF) (with Margaret Ng)
