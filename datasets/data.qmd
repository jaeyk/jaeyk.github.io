I develop and share public datasets to strengthen the empirical
foundations of social science and expand access to knowledge for the
public good.

4.  [**MapAgora, Civic Opportunity Datasets for the Study of American
    Local Politics and Public
    Policy**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IRCA7C)
    [**\[Dashboard\]**](https://snfagora.github.io/agora_dashboard/?fbclid=IwY2xjawLaOfVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFjN0hpbTRmazRGM0FYVmdaAR6ipZf2atKm8y3rkaz7pwGfldXbCz7spdjecvdG2-BN0S7EApa2LNc_vJU-qQ_aem_f1h1LN8V-5OmYqn207OZsw)

    -   **Summary:** We introduce MapAgora, a set of five new datasets
        that provide a comprehensive view of civic opportunity across
        America. Drawing on IRS tax records and the websites of over 1.7
        million nonprofit organizations, we examine whether
        organizations offer civic opportunities, such as membership,
        volunteering, public events, or civic and political action, and
        classify them by type (e.g., political, professional,
        issue-based). The de-identified organization-level dataset
        includes indicators of civic opportunity, organizational type,
        and financial status. Four additional datasets aggregate this
        information at the ZIP code and county levels. We validate that
        civic opportunity is conceptually distinct from financial
        resources at the organizational level, while aggregate patterns
        align with traditional measures of socioeconomic inequality.
        These datasets offer new tools for understanding civic
        infrastructure, local democracy, and public policy.\

3.  [**Validated Names for Experimental Studies on Ethnicity and
    Race**](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LP4EAR) [**\[Dashboard\]**](https://jaeyk.github.io/select_validated_names/?fbclid=IwY2xjawP0TOlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFIdVoxek4zU0p0SFhzZXZJc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHm5a4tquUfrPydahJ1v3TX_HaLK7plqgT8aORGfWqVaYnyGDFhm4VdK0zE_h_aem_KusnJygN3w44M1hksHeycw)

    -   **Summary:** A large and fast-growing number of studies across the social sciences use names in experiments to signal race.
        However, names may also convey other perceived attributes such
        as socioeconomic status and citizenship. This dataset provides
        the largest collection of validated name perceptions to date,
        based on three U.S. surveys. It includes 44,170 evaluations from
        4,026 respondents for 600 names, with ratings of perceived race,
        income, education, and citizenship, along with respondent
        characteristics. These data are designed to help researchers
        isolate the causal effects of race in experimental research.\
    -   **Use case:** Featured in [*"Validated names for experimental
        studies on race and
        ethnicity"*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01947-0),

2.  [**Linked Fate Literature Review Dataset
    (1999–2019)**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=5194002&version=1.0)

    -   **Summary:** A hand-coded dataset of 160 studies on linked fate
        published between 1999 and 2019. It captures definitions,
        measurement strategies, theoretical framings, and the
        populations studied in political science and related
        disciplines.\
    -   **Use case:** Used in [*"Rewiring Linked Fate: Bringing Back
        History, Agency, and
        Power"*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/rewiring-linked-fate-bringing-back-history-agency-and-power/CF08421CA51138DF922AB05F056E80B7),

1.  [**Asian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service
    Organizations Dataset
    (1868–2016)**](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FLUPBJ)

    -   **Summary:** A historical dataset documenting over 800 nonprofit organizations serving Asian American and Latino communities in the U.S. from 1868 to 2016. It includes founding years, organizational types (advocacy, service, hybrid), and panethnic status. The dataset captures both early ethnic organizations and
        those that evolved into panethnic entities, such as the National
        Council of La Raza (NCLR). Validation relied on websites, news
        archives, and outreach, with founding dates confirmed for 77% of
        Asian and 71% of Latino organizations.\
    -   **Use case:** Used in [*"How Other Minorities Gained Access: The
        War on Poverty and Asian American and Latino Community
        Organizing"*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1065912920983456),
        *Political Research Quarterly* (2021).
