title: "Community building"
---

I love learning from other people who share similar research interests and building interdisciplinary communities. I have developed a large and growing network of [collaborators](coauthors.md) across social sciences, data science, engineering, and design. I also have close relationships with several research labs across institutions: Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute's P3 Lab (PI: Hahrie Han), Harvard Kennedy School's Civic Power Lab (PI: Liz McKenna), UCLA's Race, Ethnicity, Politics, & Society (REPS) Lab (PI: Efrén Pérez), and Georgetown McCourt School's Better Government Lab (PI: Donald Moynihan, Pamela Herd, Sebastian Jilke, and Eric Giannella).

I have contributed to expanding the field of computational social science in both the U.S. and South Korea. I co-organized the first partner location of [the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) (SICSS) in [the Bay Area](https://sicss.io/2020/bay_area/) (2020, co-hosted by UC Berkeley and Stanford) and [South Korea](https://sicss.io/2022/korea/) (2022, co-hosted by KAIST and KDI School). I currently serve on [the advisory board of SICSS](https://sicss.io/people).

I have also served on panels on data science career paths at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2).
