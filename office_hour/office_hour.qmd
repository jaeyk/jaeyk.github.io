## UNC Student Office Hour

I hold weekly 30-minute office hours for UNC students on Fridays between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM in my office (Abernethy Hall, Room 216A). 
If you are interested, [please feel free to make an appointment](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/d68c72d12207404bbbdf6879a13da2cf@unc.edu?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=plink).

Abernethy Hall is near Franklin Street, next to Hanes Art Center and the Kenan Music Building. My office is on the second floor. Please walk upstairs, as there is no elevator; it is only a two-story building. When you reach the second floor, turn left and continue down the hall.
