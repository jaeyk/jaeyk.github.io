    "section": "",
    "text": "A Dual Life\nIn 2023, I was living a kind of dual life. I was a data scientist at Code for America, working on digital access to safety net programs. At the same time, I held an academic affiliation with the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins, continuing to write and collaborate on political science research. My day job was deeply practical and policy-oriented. My evenings and weekends were devoted to research, writing, and academic seminars.\nThis duality wasn’t just about time management; it was about navigating two institutional worlds. But it also reflected the deeper structure of my work. Even at Code for America, my projects had an academic-facing element. I worked on field experiments and policy evaluations in partnership with the Better Government Lab at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy and the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy. These collaborations helped bridge the line between implementation and research, between public service and public knowledge.\nBalancing both roles was demanding. But I chose this path because I believe scholarship shouldn’t just describe the world; it should help improve it. I want my research to be rigorous, but also relevant. And that belief has shaped how I think of myself today.\nA Question of Identity\nAt the 2023 American Political Science Association (APSA) annual meeting, a colleague asked me a simple question: “So, are you a political scientist or a data scientist now?”\nI paused. Then I said, “I think of myself as a policy scientist.”\nIt’s not a title that appears on business cards. But it captures what I do and what I care about. I study how public policies are created, delivered, and experienced. And I work to make government more responsive, equitable, and effective, not in theory, but in practice.\nThat goal led me into political science. And it’s the same goal that, for a time, led me outside of it.\nWhy Political Science Matters\nPolicy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Even the best-designed solutions can fail if they don’t survive the political process. That’s why I chose political science over economics. Economics offers sharp tools, but often narrows its focus to efficiency. Political science brings power, institutions, and values into the frame. It reminds us that a “good” policy must also be a just one, and a legitimate one.\nBut I’ve come to believe that political science, as practiced, has two persistent gaps.\nThe first is access. Most academics don’t have access to the internal data or conversations that drive government decision-making. As a result, we often rely on incomplete or surface-level information.\nThe second is experience. Many political scientists haven’t worked inside government. So we miss the incentives, constraints, and organizational realities that shape what actually gets implemented.\nThese aren’t fatal flaws. But they do limit how much impact research can have. I stepped into the practitioner world to better understand those gaps and to begin bridging them.\nWhat I Learned in the Field\nWithin nine months at Code for America, I had learned more about public administration than in any single seminar I had taken in graduate school. I learned how eligibility flows are built into backend systems, how frontline staff manage tradeoffs under pressure, and what kinds of interventions agencies are actually willing to pilot.\nNone of this came from reading theory. It came from co-designing projects with county and state governments, launching field experiments, and troubleshooting implementation problems in real time.\nAnd yet, the more I engaged with practice, the more I rediscovered the value of research.\nPractitioners are deep in the weeds. Researchers step back. Both perspectives are incomplete on their own, but powerful when combined. Research makes sense of patterns, names concepts, and connects cases. Practice reminds us what’s feasible, what’s urgent, and what actually matters to those doing the work.\nHow Politics Shapes Policy\nGood ideas fail all the time. Not because they’re unworkable, but because they’re politically inconvenient. Policy decisions are filtered through institutions, norms, and power dynamics.\nThat’s where political science has something essential to offer. It reminds us that implementation is not just technical; it’s political. It’s about who has discretion, what rules are enforced, and whose interests are prioritized.\nSometimes policies fail because senior officials don’t understand frontline needs. Other times, staff lack access to insights held by clients. These breakdowns aren’t just process failures. They’re symptoms of deeper misalignments in authority, communication, and design.\nPolitical science once played a central role in studying these dynamics. Implementation (1973) by Pressman and Wildavsky helped define a generation of policy research. But over time, much of that work shifted to public administration. I believe political science still has a vital role to play, especially if it returns to the front lines of how policy is experienced.\nWhat I Carry Forward\nWorking outside academia didn’t make me less of a political scientist. If anything, it helped me become a more grounded one. It taught me where the real points of friction are, between ideals and incentives, between design and delivery.\nI still care about theory. I still care about publication. But I also care about building the kind of research that public institutions can actually use, research that informs, illuminates, and sometimes even shapes the choices governments make.\nI didn’t stop being a political scientist when I left campus. If anything, I became a better one. And I believe that those of us who move between research and practice have a role to play, not just in translating ideas, but in shaping a future where scholarship and service are no longer separate paths.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I came from South Korea, so people I’ve met in the U.S. often ask if I’m from Seoul. Given that one in two South Koreans live in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, that’s not a bad guess. Chances are, they’ve met lots of Seoulites. It’s also true that most South Koreans who come to the U.S. for education or work tend to come from that region. In fact, my wife is one of them.\nBut I was born and raised in a small town outside Jeonju, a city known for its rich history and delicious food (in my opinion, the best foodie town in Korea). I lived there until I was 11. Then I moved to Daejeon, a bigger city, though still much smaller than Seoul, where I stayed through high school, before heading to Seoul for college. That’s where I landed my first job and eventually got married.\nGrowing up, we didn’t have much. Ours was a single-earner, extended family household. My dad worked in a paper mill. My mom stayed home and raised two kids while also caring for my paternal grandparents. Back then, my biggest wish was to have a place where I could borrow books. I didn’t even know libraries existed, since there were none nearby. The only place I could read was a small neighborhood bookstore. It wasn’t a curated independent shop. It was just a humble store with rows of magazines, fiction paperbacks, and student prep books for the college entrance exam. My allowance was limited, so I couldn’t buy what I wanted. Instead, I’d stand and read quickly, pretending to browse. That’s how I first taught myself to read fast.\nOf course, it wasn’t all hardship. The town was surrounded by farms and low hills. It was the kind of place where kids could explore, wander, and feel part of the natural world. Many of our groceries came directly from farmers. Long before I knew the term “farmers market,” that was just how our market worked. Knowing where the food came from, and who grew it, taught us to appreciate it differently. Both sides of my family had roots in farming, and I often spent time on my grandparents’ farms. I began to notice how vegetables and fruits tasted different depending on the farm, the season, and even the grower. What people now call “farm-to-table” was just everyday life for us. We didn’t eat much meat, but we rarely ate processed food either.\nNow that I study poverty and inequality in America, I see how much South Korea has changed too, including my hometown, which is now industrialized. Looking back, I realize that not all working-class kids had regular access to fresh food or green environments. But at the time, I didn’t think much of it. It simply felt like the normal rhythm of life.\nThere was also something else. A kind of informal afterschool care rooted in the community. After walking home from school, a walk I had been doing safely on my own since kindergarten, which was normal at the time, if my mom wasn’t home, I’d go to a friend’s house. Parents took turns hosting, rotating responsibilities in an informal mutual support system. It was never called a “program,” but it worked.\nLooking back, I feel deeply grateful for that small-town childhood. It wasn’t just the delicious food or the beautiful natural surroundings. It was the way those experiences taught me to pay attention, to appreciate simple things, and to share kindness. I learned how the seasons shape what we eat, how nature is something we live with rather than apart from, and how neighbors look after one another even without formal structures. These are lessons I still carry. They remind me of where I began and the values that continue to guide me.\nSince then, I’ve lived in more than ten cities across five countries on two continents. Some have been megacities like Seoul. But I’ve never forgotten my roots or the small-town lessons I carried with me.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I begin drafting my first book project, which examines the War on Poverty, I have been thinking about an earlier generation of scholars who tried to capture the politics of implementation as it unfolded on the ground. One of the most ambitious efforts came out of Berkeley in the 1970s: the Oakland Project.\nMost people studying implementation know Jeffrey Pressman and Aaron Wildavsky’s Implementation: How Great Expectations in Washington Are Dashed in Oakland; or, Why It’s Amazing that Federal Programs Work at All… (1973). With its famously long subtitle, it remains a classic in the study of policy implementation. What is less widely remembered is that Implementation was part of a larger University of California Press series, the Publications in the Oakland Project.\nThe series contained at least six volumes. It began with Arnold Meltsner’s The Politics of City Revenue (1971) and included Frank Thompson’s Personnel Policy in the City (1975). Implementation was the second book. Collectively, these volumes were an ambitious attempt to analyze how War on Poverty programs actually played out at the street level. The project was not just an academic exercise. It was funded by NASA, the Urban Institute, and HUD, and it was structured as an applied partnership with the city of Oakland.\nMany of the contributors were colleagues and students of Aaron Wildavsky, the Berkeley political scientist who went on to found the Goldman School of Public Policy. Alongside Wildavsky and Pressman, the roster included Arnold Meltsner, Frank Levy, William Lunch, Frank Thompson, and Jesse McCorry. With the exception of Meltsner, who was Wildavsky’s colleague and a fellow founding faculty member of the Goldman School, most were his students who went on to long and distinguished careers. McCorry, who completed his doctorate at Berkeley, authored the final volume, Marcus Foster and the Oakland Public Schools (1978). Pressman’s career was tragically cut short when he died at only 33 while serving as an associate professor at MIT. Implementation was only his second book.\nOthers contributed research outside the University of California Press series. Judith V. May, for example, authored Citizen Participation: A Review of the Literature (1971), published through ERIC. Archival records also note graduate students who assisted the project but did not publish volumes of their own.\nWildavsky’s legacy continues today in both academia and practice. The Goldman School hosts the annual Aaron Wildavsky Lecture, with Jamila Michener of Cornell scheduled for 2025. APSA honors him with two major awards: the Aaron Wildavsky Enduring Contribution Award (Public Policy Section) and the Aaron Wildavsky Dissertation Award (Religion and Politics Section). His influence also reaches into today’s civic technology world. Jennifer Pahlka, founder of Code for America (where I once worked as a data scientist) and author of Recoding America, cited Implementation as her favorite book in an interview with Ezra Klein. That moment shows how a study of War on Poverty programs in Oakland, written more than fifty years ago, still shapes how reformers think about the politics of public programs.\nWhat we need now is scholarship that blends political science, public administration, and policy analysis with a sustained focus on the messy realities of implementation. The Oakland Project showed that such work is possible. I hope to continue this mission in my own book project, which examines the War on Poverty. At the same time, I aim to expand the implementation literature by connecting it to the politics of community organizing in race- and class-subjugated communities, stories of the War on Poverty that have rarely been part of the mainstream literature on public administration and policymaking.\nThe Oakland Project Series by the University of California Press\n\nMeltsner, Arnold J. 1971.

    "text": "By the end of my second year in graduate school, I made a shift: I moved from comparative to American politics. It wasn’t part of any grand plan. I just started to notice something. American scholars were often seen as experts on the politics of other countries, but rarely the other way around. I believed international students like me also had something to say about American politics. We carried perspectives shaped by distance and difference. That, I thought, could be a contribution, not a liability.\nBut the moment I entered that conversation, I felt what it meant to be on the outside. I began attending seminars and workshops where I was often the only non-native English speaker, and one of the only racial or ethnic minorities in the room.\nArticulating complex ideas in a second or third language isn’t just hard. It can be humiliating. The real challenge isn’t grammar or vocabulary. It’s knowing, deep down, that someone in the room is already questioning your intellect before you’ve finished your sentence. I didn’t need training in social psychology to know this was happening. Over the years, I heard it directly from people I respected: comments about my accent, my word choice, or the way I sounded “less certain.”\nThe first time it happened, it felt like a punch to the stomach. I don’t believe those colleagues were malicious. I think they were unaware. But even casual comments, when repeated often enough, add up. One remark may seem harmless. But when you hear it enough, it becomes something sharp. A thousand paper cuts, quietly accumulated.\nAt some point, I wrote down what I was feeling. I shared an early version of this reflection while I was still in graduate school, still unsure if I truly belonged. I braced for silence. But something unexpected happened instead.\nPeople reached out. They offered mentorship, solidarity, support. Some of them became mentors who opened doors I didn’t even know existed. Others became collaborators, allies, friends. Their kindness helped me finish my degree. But more than that, it helped me believe that I had a place in this field, not as an exception, but as someone who belonged.\nThat experience changed how I show up in academia. These days, whenever I attend a conference, I extend a simple invitation: Let me buy you a coffee or tea. If you’re a graduate student (especially if you’re international, a minority, or unsure of your place), please reach out.\nI’ve mentored dozens of students across backgrounds, inside and outside academia. I do it because others did it for me. And because no one should have to navigate this alone.\nI also carry that mindset into my teaching. I work hard to create spaces where students from non-traditional backgrounds can find their footing, develop their skills, and feel seen. I want them to know what I often didn’t: that their voice, however it sounds, is something to protect, not correct.\nIf you’re a political scientist reading this, thank you. And I have one request: if you believe, as I do, that our field should be more inclusive and open to different ways of speaking, thinking, and being, then be mindful of how you talk about language. Please don’t write comments like “The author is not a native speaker.” It doesn’t help. It doesn’t improve the work. It just narrows the space of who gets to be taken seriously.\nWe don’t need more subtle signals of exclusion. We need more acts of generosity. Sometimes that means offering a second read. Sometimes it means choosing silence over critique. And sometimes it means using your voice to help someone else find theirs.\nBecause at the end of the day, doing scholarship isn’t just about publishing. It’s about belonging. It’s about finding your voice and finding the people who help you keep it.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "How Opportunities Travel: A Guide to Academic Networking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Networking isn’t optional in academia; it’s essential.\nI didn’t come to this realization naturally. I’m not someone who thrives on large social events or group dinners. In fact, I avoided most school functions as an undergraduate in Korea. I preferred spending time alone: running outdoors during the day, listening to music, cooking, or reading at home in the evenings.\nIn the course of building my career, though, I learned that opportunities don’t come from effort and talent alone. They come when your work is known and remembered by people who can open doors. That only happens if you’re willing to show up, ask questions, and build relationships. Not once, but again and again.\nThis isn’t always intuitive, especially for international students or first-generation scholars. But networking is a skill. It can be learned, practiced, and improved.\nHere are five lessons that helped me, and may help you too.\n1. Define your value\nAcademic networking starts before you reach out to anyone. It begins with understanding what you have to offer and what you’re genuinely curious about. Before writing to someone, ask: If I were in their position, why would I want to meet me?\nThat reflection shapes everything: your message, your tone, even your questions.\nWhen I email someone I admire, I try to connect my interests to theirs in a way that’s specific and sincere. Sometimes I point to an overlap in topics or methods. Sometimes I reference a paper or book of theirs I found particularly useful. Either way, I do my homework and I make it easy for them to see why a short meeting could be worthwhile.\nA message that shows you’ve engaged with their work, and have something meaningful to discuss, is far more compelling than a list of accomplishments.\nPeople are busy. But most are also generous, especially when they can tell you’ve made the effort to reach out thoughtfully.\n2. Lower the stakes\nProfessors are busy. Postdocs and graduate students are too, but faculty often carry additional institutional responsibilities, including advising students, writing recommendation letters, and serving on committees.\nSo keep your messages short. Really short.\nStart with one short paragraph explaining why you appreciate their work. Be specific: a paper you found helpful, a talk that stayed with you, a project you admire.\nFollow with a second paragraph briefly introducing yourself and what you’re working on, especially if it connects to their interests.\nThen close with a third paragraph politely asking if they might have 30 minutes to meet. Keep the tone low-pressure, and frame it as a conversation rather than a favor.\nIf they don’t respond to you, that’s fine. Don’t take it personally. Sometimes I follow up the next year by saying, “I reached out last time but didn’t get a chance to connect: I’d still love to talk if you’re open.” That approach has led to some of my most valuable conversations.\n3. Be a service to others\nNetworking doesn’t begin or end with asking for advice. Often, the most durable academic relationships begin when you create value for others.\nIn 2019, during my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, I attended the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science at Princeton. The organizers encouraged participants to help expand the program’s reach. So the following year, I volunteered to co-organize a new site in the Bay Area, hosted by Berkeley and Stanford.\nThat small act, organizing something for others, connected me with dozens of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students across disciplines. Many of them have since become coauthors, collaborators, and close colleagues. It also brought me into contact with Code for America, a civic tech nonprofit we invited to collaborate. That one encounter eventually led to a full-time job as a data scientist there. I have so many experiences like this.\nI didn’t think of networking as a way to advance my career. I thought of it as a way to contribute. Being useful, without expecting anything back, often does more to build lasting relationships than any self-serving approach ever could. And usefulness tends to be remembered.\nYou don’t have to organize a conference to do this. You can offer feedback on a draft, amplify someone’s work online, or help coordinate a small reading group. Small contributions often lead to deeper connections.\n4. Build your board of advisors\nNetworking isn’t a one-time push. It’s a lifelong process of relationship-building. Some people become mentors. Others become mentees. Some become friends, coauthors, or informal sounding boards.\nIn the course of building my career, I’ve come to think of this as building a “personal advisory board.” It’s not just about your dissertation committee. You need different kinds of support at different stages: people who understand the job market, others who can give feedback on early-stage ideas, and others who can help you navigate big career transitions.\nAnd it’s not just reciprocal. You rise higher when you lift others along the way. The strongest networks are built on shared success, not competition.\n5. Treat it as a skill, not a trait\nI didn’t grow up thinking I was good at networking. I still don’t love big receptions or happy hours. But I’ve learned how to build relationships in ways that feel authentic to me. And that’s the point. There’s no single right way to do this.\nWhat matters is that you keep showing up, keep learning, and stay open to connection.\nNetworking is how opportunities travel. Talent matters. So does timing. But often, it’s a conversation that turns effort into momentum.\nAnd like any skill, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Years ago, after delivering my first practice job talk, a colleague offered a piece of feedback that stayed with me: “This is a good research talk, but it’s not enough for a job talk.” At the time, I was unsure what that meant. I had worked hard to organize the research clearly, present the methods carefully, and explain the findings in detail. Wasn’t that what a job talk was supposed to do?\nOver time, I came to understand the distinction. A research talk is primarily about communicating results. A job talk asks for something more. It is about persuading a group of future colleagues that you are someone they want to invest in, work with, and build a department around. A strong job talk does not only present a research project. It also conveys something about the person behind the work. Departments are not just hiring a project. They are hiring a colleague.\nSeen this way, the job talk looks different. It is not only about the plot of the research, meaning the data, models, and results. It is also about character: the choices you made in designing the study, the questions that motivated you, the way you communicate ideas, and the direction your work is headed. A job talk is a form of storytelling, and you are part of the story you are telling.\nBased on this experience, I found it helpful to keep six principles in mind while preparing my job talks."

    "section": "1. It’s Not About You",
    "text": "1. It’s Not About You\nIt is easy to fixate on your own anxieties, whether about slide design, methodological complexity, or technical detail. But these concerns are often different from what the audience is evaluating. Departments tend to focus on broader questions: Is this person good at what they do? Do they show promise for future work? Would they be a good colleague and teacher in our department? A strong job talk helps the audience answer these questions.\nMany faculty members will only encounter you through the job talk, either live or recorded. Even if a search committee is enthusiastic, the final decision often depends on a wider faculty vote. In that context, the impression created during the talk carries significant weight. You cannot assume deep familiarity with your field or topic. You need to meet the audience where they are: busy, curious, and often distracted.\nThere is no such thing as a perfect job talk. Perfection is neither possible nor expected. Evaluations are subjective and shaped by departmental needs, intellectual interests, and individual perspectives. What matters is not flawlessness, but whether you deliver a clear and engaging talk that leaves colleagues interested in your work and confident about you as a scholar."

They are looking for signs of intellectual curiosity, good judgment, resilience, and the ability to collaborate. Even an excellent paper may not carry a job talk if the audience cannot imagine you thriving as a colleague.

    "text": "3. Tell One Clear Story\nJob talks take place in rooms full of busy people. Clarity matters as much as substance. From the opening minutes, you need to explain why your research matters and why the audience should care. Once you have their attention, guide them through the key challenges and choices in a focused way. Return regularly to your central message so that even late arrivals or momentarily distracted listeners can follow the argument.\nA strong job talk is not a data dump. It is a tightly structured narrative built around one main takeaway: why this work matters, why it matters now, and why you are the right person to do it. Since most people will retain only one core idea, you should decide in advance what that idea is and reinforce it throughout the talk."

    "text": "4. Show, Don’t Tell\nSlides should support the story rather than compete with it. When possible, rely on figures or visuals instead of dense text. Keep words to a minimum and use fonts large enough to be read from the back of the room. Avoid unnecessary clutter, including labels or captions that do not add meaning.\nNever read directly from your slides. Doing so can give the impression of unpreparedness, and that impression is difficult to undo. Slides should highlight what is hard to convey verbally, not serve as a script. Trying to cover too much material often leads to rushing, and rushing almost always weakens the talk."

    "text": "5. Practice Until the Talk Feels Natural\nAim to do at least three full practice talks before your first flyout. The first practice usually reveals structural issues. The second helps refine the narrative and pacing. The third allows you to focus on delivery. Once flyouts begin, it becomes much harder to find time and space to rehearse.\nBefore each practice, be clear about the kind of feedback you want and how you want to receive it. Recording practice talks can also be helpful for tracking recurring questions and improving transitions. Not every issue needs to be resolved during the talk itself. Some points can be left for the Q&A, where you can steer discussion toward your strengths. Preparing appendix slides for anticipated questions is often useful.\nWith enough practice, you develop a sense of ease with the material: the key message, the flow of the narrative, the transitions between slides, and your strategy for handling questions."

    "text": "6. Feeling nervous is normal\nFeeling nervous is normal. Mild anxiety can sharpen focus and improve performance. Problems arise only when anxiety becomes overwhelming.\nI found it helpful to build small pre-talk routines, such as controlled breathing, simple grounding exercises, bringing warm tea, and preparing backups of my slides on multiple devices. I even traveled with two suits in case something went wrong. These strategies worked for me, though others may have different preferences. Anticipating small risks helped keep my nerves manageable.\nThe goal is not to eliminate anxiety, but to keep it at a level where it becomes a source of energy rather than a burden. Preparation is what makes that possible.\nLooking back, I am grateful to the colleague who pushed me to think more carefully about the difference between a research talk and a job talk. That shift changed not only how I prepared, but also how I presented myself. Strong research is essential. But ultimately, it is the story of who you are, and who you are becoming as a scholar, that leaves the most lasting impression."

    "title": "Four Tips on How to Approach Job Interviews",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI’ve had a non-linear career path. Along the way, I’ve interviewed for roles in the private sector, nonprofits, and academia, and I’ve also served on hiring committees across those sectors. With time, I’ve come to see interviews less as high-stakes performances and more as conversations: opportunities to figure out whether you and the organization are truly a good fit.\nThese four tips are things I wish I had known earlier in my career. They might seem obvious to seasoned professionals, but they’re not always intuitive to people just entering the job market, whether in academia or beyond.\n1. Hiring is about solving a problem: focus on how you’re the solution\nEvery hiring process begins with a problem. A team needs capacity, a department needs expertise, a program needs leadership. Your goal in an interview is not to prove how smart or qualified you are; it’s to show how you can help solve that specific problem.\nSometimes, the problem is clearly stated in the job ad. But often, it takes some digging. If you have contacts inside the organization, ask them what the real needs are. If you don’t, you can still ask the search committee chair (in academia) or the recruiter or hiring manager (in other settings). That’s their job, and most will be willing to offer insight.\nGood preparation begins with understanding what the other side wants and needs. From there, you can tailor your responses to show that you’re not just qualified; you’re aligned.\n2. Be yourself, and remember: you’re interviewing them too\nIt’s easy to feel like you have to mold yourself into the “ideal” candidate. But that instinct can backfire. The best interviews happen when you speak with clarity about who you are and what kind of work you want to do. If the organization isn’t drawn to that, it might not be the right place for you.\nAn interview is a mutual learning process. If, by the end, you realize the values or goals don’t align, then not getting the offer is actually a useful outcome. Another opportunity will come, one where you won’t feel the need to hide or shrink who you are.\n3. Listen as much as you speak\nInterviews vary by sector. In academia, you give a job talk and answer questions. In other sectors, you often go through rounds of one-on-one or panel interviews. But across contexts, one principle holds: conversation beats monologue.\nTreat your responses as invitations, not conclusions. When others speak, really listen. Take notes. Echo back what they’ve said to show understanding. It might seem small, but these habits leave a lasting impression.\nPeople might not remember the exact words you said. But they will remember how you made them feel. Make them feel heard. Make them feel respected.\n4. Know your audience, and make their job easier\nInterviewers often have to meet multiple candidates. It’s time-consuming, and sometimes exhausting. One of the kindest things you can do is make their experience even 10% more pleasant.\nBefore the interview, learn who your interviewers are. Read their bios. Look up their work. In academic settings, you can reference their interests directly in your talk. In other contexts, you can tailor your questions based on what they do.\nWhen they ask if you have any questions, don’t use that time to negotiate or express your doubts. Save that for after the offer. Instead, ask questions that reflect curiosity about their work or their vision for the team. It signals that you’ve done your homework and that you’re thinking like a future colleague.\nConclusion\nEvery interview is a little stressful. That’s normal. But it’s also a chance to learn, not just about potential roles, but about yourself. The better you understand your own values, the more clearly you’ll see whether a place feels like home.\nAnd sometimes, the best way to help yourself in an interview is to focus on helping the other side. Make it easy for them to see how you fit. Make it easy for them to remember you, because of how you made them feel.\nIf you’ve found something useful here, I hope you’ll pass it along. And if you have tips of your own, I’d love to hear them.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Raising a Good Trouble-Maker",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was sometimes asked, as a political scientist, what kind of dinner conversations I had with my parents and whether we ever talked about politics. The truth is, we didn’t talk about politics at dinner or at all; in fact, we rarely shared a family meal together.\nI grew up in a household shaped by the rhythms of collective labor and strict hierarchy, values my father carried from his childhood on a rice farm, where everyone worked together from dawn to dusk and orders went unquestioned. When he later worked as an electrician in a paper mill, the setting shifted from rural fields to noisy factory floors, but the demands remained just as relentless: early mornings, long hours, late nights. My parents tried to carve out fun with occasional day trips on a tight budget, but real holidays and vacations were still few and far between. Even now, I struggle to plan or enjoy a break because I never had a clear model for what that looks like.\nGiven my own difficult childhood, I hesitated to become a father. But fatherhood has been a second chance to live the childhood I missed, and it all happens through my daughter’s eyes. She truly is my sunshine: outgoing and radiant, already a budding artist who draws, sings, and dances; a devoted fan of unicorns, squirrels, and cats; and the proud author of her first comic book. I love her not just because she’s my daughter, but because her boundless energy and curiosity remind me every day what wonder feels like.\nWhen my daughter arrived, I resolved to create something very different. I wanted her to know that trouble-making, when done with respect and purpose, is essential to change. I explain which rules deserve our respect and which deserve our questions. I encourage her to claim her rights and speak up whenever she sees unfairness, trusting that her perspective matters.\nMy emphasis on “good trouble” was inspired by the late Congressman John Lewis, who urged us to “get in good trouble, necessary trouble.” Lewis, son of an Alabama sharecropper, learned from Rosa Parks and the civil-rights movement that moral courage sometimes means breaking unjust rules. I want my daughter to understand that she has choices, to make them boldly, and to own the consequences.\nTo bring these lessons alive, I draw on my Harvard Kennedy School colleague Marshall Ganz’s Public Narrative framework, an approach that guides my research, my teaching, and even my parenting. At home, whether we’re at the dinner table, walking through the neighborhood, or riding bikes together, I’ll ask questions like:\n\nStory of Self: “What did you do at school today, and which moment made you feel proud or frustrated?”\nStory of Us: “Did you notice friends having similar moments, times they felt proud or frustrated, and what happened for them?”\nStory of Now: “Did you see anything that didn’t seem fair, or any act of kindness, and what could you and your friends do about it?”\n\nShe may not yet know words like “agency,” “collective action,” or “public narrative,” but I trust these conversations will become part of her inner compass. I have no idea what the future holds, but I want her to tell her own story, listen to others with empathy, and build a community grounded in shared purpose.\nIn our home, good trouble-making is a commitment to shared values and a shared future. It isn’t about chaos or disrespect; it’s about curiosity, courage, and community: asking hard questions, claiming the space to be heard, and working alongside others who share your concerns. That’s the kind of good trouble I hope she, and we, continue to make.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "“Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing.”\n– John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859), Chapter 3\n\nI am committed to providing excellent and accessible learning experiences for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2021, I earned a Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education from UC Berkeley. In 2017, I received the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award for my instruction in undergraduate quantitative methods and research design. Given to fewer than ten percent of graduate student instructors, the award recognized the quality of my teaching even in my first semester in the classroom.\nMy pedagogical approach combines liberal arts–style broad intellectual foundations with design school–style hands-on experiences. My strength as an instructor comes from interdisciplinary training and extensive applied experience. My objective is to help students build strong intellectual foundations while simultaneously developing the habits of mind that allow them to tackle new problems. Guided by these principles, my teaching in public policy and data science emphasizes engagement with big ideas and cutting-edge scholarship, alongside sustained attention to practical applications and ethical implications.\nCurrent Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)\n\nThe Politics of Public Policy [course website]\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)\n\nThe following three courses form an integrated sequence in public policy data science, grounded in a domain-first approach. Rather than treating data science as a purely technical endeavor, the sequence begins with the policy problems themselves—emphasizing how data, computation, and artificial intelligence can be used in context to advance the public good. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance—from algorithmic decision-making to digital service delivery and researcher-practitioner collaboration. Together, they prepare students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data and AI in the policy process, equipping them with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled solutions to public problems.\n\nData, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy\n\nThis course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and AI systems are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. The topics span multiple stages of governance, from lawmaking and adjudication to implementation, mainly in the U.S. with comparative perspectives. Particular attention is given to the challenges of balancing efficiency gains (promised by algorithmic systems) with the protection of public values in machine-mediated decision-making embedded in existing institutional and organizational contexts. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems in ways that advance public values and align with the goals and constraints of public governance.\n\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service\n\nThis course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI agents in shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to incorporate the lived experiences of people who rely on government services and are often underserved by them.\n\nEvidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact\n\nThis course examines how data scientists (or evaluators) can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses, and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative process and use of evidence for public impact.\n\n\n\n Courses Taught (UC Berkeley, KDI School, etc)\n\n\nGraduate Seminars\n\nKDI School of Public Policy and Management\n\nR Fundamentals for Public Policy (Spring 2022, Fall 2022)\nData Visualization and Communication (Summer 2022)\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nIntroduction to Computational Tools for Social Science\n\nInstructor of record: Spring 2019, Spring 2021\n\nGraduate Student Instructor (GSI): Fall 2016 (with Rachel Bernhard)\n\nDigital Data Collection Workshop (Fall 2020, with Nick Kuipers)\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Lectures\n\nIntroduction to Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Methods (UC Berkeley, Fall 2016)\n\nGSI for Laura Stoker\n\nOutstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-conference Tutorials\n\n\nIC2S2 (2024): Training CSS PhDs for Academic & Non-Academic Careers\nSICSS-Howard (2021): R Bootcamp – Invited Instructor\n\n\n\n\nWorkshops (Selected)\n\n\nDoing Social Science with Generative AI: Research Design, Practical Tools, and Ethical Considerations, Korea University (2025) – Invited Instructor\nSummer Institute in Migration Research Methods, UC Berkeley (2024) – Invited Instructor\n\nDigital Data Collection, Korea University (2022) – Invited Instructor\n\nUC Berkeley D-Lab (2020–2021):\n\nFairness and Bias in Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning in R\n\nSQL for R Users\n\nFunctional Programming in R\n\nR Package Development\n\nAdvanced Data Wrangling\n\nProject Management in R\n\nR Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\n\nGuest Lectures (Selected)\n\n\n2025 – Johns Hopkins: NLP for CSS, Brown: Watson Institute’s GPD Module, Korea University\n2024 – Johns Hopkins: Democracy by the Numbers\n\n2023 – Wesleyan: Democracy in East Asia\n\n2022 – National University of Singapore, KAIST, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University\n\n2021 – KAIST, Dartmouth\n\n\n\n\nPedagogical Publications and Resources\n\n\nTextbook: Computational Thinking for Social Scientists\nAn open-access textbook (CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0) that equips social scientists with modern computational skills: reproducible workflows (Git, Bash, tidy data), functional programming in R, data product development, semi-structured data collection, computational text analysis, predictive modeling, and database management with SQL.

Drawing on IRS tax records and the websites of over 1.7 million nonprofit organizations, we examine whether organizations offer civic opportunities, such as membership, volunteering, public events, or civic and political action, and classify them by type (e.g., political, professional, issue-based). The de-identified organization-level dataset includes indicators of civic opportunity, organizational type, and financial status. Four additional datasets aggregate this information at the ZIP code and county levels. We validate that civic opportunity is conceptually distinct from financial resources at the organizational level, while aggregate patterns align with traditional measures of socioeconomic inequality. These datasets offer new tools for understanding civic infrastructure, local democracy, and public policy.\n\nUse case: Featured in “MapAgora, Civic Opportunity Datasets for the Study of American Local Politics and Public Policy”, Nature: Scientific Data (2025), and “The Unequal Landscape of Civic Opportunity in America”, Nature Human Behaviour (2023), with Milan de Vries and Hahrie Han\n\nCollaborator: Milan de Vries and Hahrie Han\n\nValidated Names for Experimental Studies on Ethnicity and Race [Dashboard]\n\nSummary: A large and fast-growing number of studies across the social sciences use names in experiments to signal race. However, names may also convey other perceived attributes such as socioeconomic status and citizenship. This dataset provides the largest collection of validated name perceptions to date, based on three U.S. surveys. It includes 44,170 evaluations from 4,026 respondents for 600 names, with ratings of perceived race, income, education, and citizenship, along with respondent characteristics. These data are designed to help researchers isolate the causal effects of race in experimental research.\n\nUse case: Featured in “Validated names for experimental studies on race and ethnicity”, Nature: Scientific Data (2023), with Charles Crabtree, S. Michael Gaddis, John B. Holbein, Cameron Guage, and William Marx.\n\nCollaborator: Charles Crabtree, S. Michael Gaddis, John B. Holbein, Cameron Guage, and William Marx\n\nAsian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service Organizations Dataset [Dashboard]\n\nSummary: A historical dataset documenting over 800 nonprofit organizations serving Asian American and Latino communities in the U.S. from 1868 to 2016. It includes founding years, organizational types (advocacy, service, hybrid), and panethnic status. The dataset captures both early ethnic organizations and those that evolved into panethnic entities, such as the National Council of La Raza (NCLR). Validation relied on websites, news archives, and outreach, with founding dates confirmed for 77% of Asian and 71% of Latino organizations.\n\nUse case: Used in “How Other Minorities Gained Access: The War on Poverty and Asian American and Latino Community Organizing”, Political Research Quarterly (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Back to top\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Jae Yeon Kim\n\n\n jaekim@unc.edu |  CV |  Google Scholar |  LinkedIn |  Substack |  GitHub\n\n\nMy research aims to make policy implementation work.\n\n\n\nHello! I am Jae.\nI am an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a non-resident Research Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and a Better Government Lab Fellow at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy. I co-founded the Data for Good Roundtables and serve on the Advisory Council of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, the Procurement Committee at the GovAI Coalition, and the APSA Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. In Spring 2027, I will be on research leave and visiting UC Berkeley’s Berkeley Economy & Society Initiative.\nPreviously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Code for America, where I collaborated with the U.S. government to improve access to safety net programs. I also served as an Assistant Research Scientist at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where I co-developed the Mapping the Modern Agora Project. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.\nMy research focuses on making policy implementation work. I study administrative burden in safety net programs, the relationship between civic infrastructure and democratic governance, and how state and local governments use artificial intelligence to deliver public services. Across these research programs, the common thread is an American political economy (APE) framework that treats policy as a central site of political contestation.\nI’m currently working on a book project titled Unseen and Uncounted, which examines how interactions between street-level bureaucrats and non-Black minority community organizers during the War on Poverty gave rise to new racial group formations—what we know today as Asian Americans and Latinos.\nI use a wide range of methods, including big data and AI, field experiments, archival research, and human-centered design. I often collaborate with government and nonprofit partners to produce research that directly informs policy and improves practice.\nMy research has been published in Nature Human Behaviour, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Nature: Scientific Data [2x], Perspectives on Politics [2x], Political Research Quarterly [2x], Journal of Experimental Political Science, and Studies in American Political Development, among others.\nI am the recipient of the Paul Volcker Junior Scholar Research Grant Award in Public Administration (2025), Emerging Scholar Award in Civic Engagement (2024), and the Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics (2022) from the American Political Science Association, as well as the Don T. Nakanishi Award for Distinguished Scholarship and Service in Asian Pacific American Politics (2020) from the Western Political Science Association.\nI have created original datasets and data tools, including the MapAgora Civic Opportunity Data [Dashboard] and the Validated Names for Experimental Studies on Ethnicity and Race [Dashboard], both of which are publicly available for research and policy use.\n\n\n🎓 For Prospective Students\n\nPhD Students: I won’t be taking students in the coming cycle (starting in Fall 2027).\nUNC Undergrads & Graduate Students: If you’re interested in working with me, please stay tuned.

Federal agencies set official racial classifications, but their consequences were most acutely felt in local encounters between street-level bureaucrats and community members. These dynamics became especially salient during the War on Poverty, when expanding social programs created new incentives and constraints for accessing public resources. When the cost of recognizing small, fragmented, or poorly understood immigrant populations was deemed too high, the state defaulted to residual labels like “Other.”\nFaced with exclusion from official categories, ethnic elites engaged in political innovation. They coined new panethnic labels, built coalitions across national-origin lines, and established civic organizations to render their communities legible to the state. These bottom-up efforts, rooted in bureaucratic encounters, enabled groups to reduce classification costs for government agencies and reshape how race was codified in policy. Over time, these strategies scaled upward, influencing federal classification schemes and institutionalizing panethnic categories such as “Asian American” and “Latino.”\nThe book draws on extensive archival research, administrative records, and digital trace data, and combines qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. Using comparative analysis across cities, racial groups, and national contexts, it shows that panethnic identities, or race-based coalition formations, were not automatic reactions to racial discrimination. Rather, they emerged through strategic adaptation to the classificatory logics and incentive structures of the modern administrative state.\nThe book also revisits the classic question of whether race or class is more politically consequential. It argues that class functioned as a cross-cutting cleavage and was essential to the formation of new racial groups in the United States during the late twentieth century. In the contemporary period, however, race and class have grown increasingly misaligned, reshaping the terrain of civil society and racial politics among these new racial groups.\nBy centering policy implementation, local political economy, and classification cost, Unseen and Uncounted reframes racial group formation as a process of political contestation, administrative negotiation, and institutional co-production. In doing so, it extends the theory of administrative burden by showing how burdens operate not only at the individual level, but also at the group level. More broadly, the book contributes to ongoing debates in political science, sociology, public administration, history, and critical data studies by offering new insight into how racial categories are constructed, contested, and institutionalized through the everyday workings of government.\nSample chapters are available upon request.

Written by social data scientist and public interest technologist Jae Yeon Kim, the book draws on real-world policy examples from the U.S. and South Korea to show how government data systems shape who gets access to benefits, who gets heard, and who gets left behind. Across ten clear and accessible chapters, Kim offers a roadmap for building a more equitable, citizen-centered digital state. From improving public service interfaces to training the next generation of civic data scientists, this book reimagines public data not just as infrastructure, but as a foundation for stronger democracy and better government.\nImpact & Recognition\n\nSelected as one of 70 finalists by the Korean Government in the popular social science category for 2024; the government purchased approximately 500 copies and distributed them to public libraries nationwide\nRecommended by the National Assembly Library, Samsung Global Research’s executive education program (SERICEO), and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)\nFeatured in major Korean newspapers across the ideological spectrum: The Chosun Ilbo, Maeil Business Newspaper, The Korea Economic Daily, Kyunghyang Shinmun, Hankyoreh\nRegular op-eds based on the book published in: Chosun Ilbo’s Civic Section (a major conservative newspaper) and Weekly Kyunghang (a major liberal magazine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“How to Use University: A Practical Guide for College Students (in Korean)” (Sejong Books, 2014) [book website]\n\nWhy do so many students enter college full of ambition—only to graduate with more confusion than clarity?\nHow to Use University is a practical, student-centered guide to navigating college with purpose, curiosity, and intention. Organized around four core themes—exploring college, learning, career, and life—it helps students shift from passive schooling to intentional, opportunity-driven learning. The book encourages students to treat the university as a launchpad—not a system to passively endure—for discovering interests, initiating projects, and building momentum. It emphasizes a key idea: unlocking even one small opportunity—especially a self-initiated project—can set off a cycle of opportunities that grows over time. With its structured framework, practical strategies, and ethos of civic-minded entrepreneurship, this book has become a trusted companion for Korean college students seeking clarity, growth, and public impact.\nImpact & Recognition\n\nThe first edition sold over 10,000 copies and has been widely recommended by educators, university counselors, and mentoring programs across South Korea\nFeatured in major Korean media outlets including Maeil Business Newspaper and Chosun Biz\nFrequently used in student development seminars and campus book clubs\nA fully revised **second edition is forthcoming in 2026.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "title": "How to Write a Statement of Purpose for Graduate School in Political Science / Public Policy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How to Write a Statement of Purpose for Graduate School in Political Science / Public Policy\nI used to joke that I’m lazy. I don’t like repeating myself. So whenever I find myself giving the same advice more than a few times, I write it down. Over the years, I’ve worked with many students (especially those from marginalized backgrounds or non-traditional academic paths) who are preparing their statement of purpose (SOP) for graduate school in political science / public policy. I’ve written this guide with them in mind.\nThe tips that follow don’t represent a universal formula. Every applicant, every reviewer, and every program is different. But these are principles I’ve seen help students write with clarity and confidence.\n1. You’re not just a candidate: you’re a solution to a problem\nPut yourself in the shoes of an admissions committee member. They’re reading dozens, sometimes hundreds of applications. What are they looking for? Not just talent, but alignment. They want to understand how you fit into the intellectual community they’re building.\nOne way to show that is to present yourself as a researcher in formation: someone who has found a problem in the field that matters, and who is ready to begin solving it. In that sense, research is a little like entrepreneurship: the most compelling projects create value. For us, that means identifying an important and unsolved puzzle in the literature and showing how your perspective, method, or data could move it forward.\nThe problem doesn’t have to be groundbreaking. In fact, most good research builds by remixing; linking literatures that rarely speak to each other, applying a method to a new context, or introducing overlooked data. The key is to show how you arrived at your puzzle, and how your background (academic, professional, personal) gives you a unique lens to address it.\n\n\n\nWatch Everything Is a Remix by Kirby Ferguson\n\n\n2. Signpost your argument: don’t make them hunt for it\nWriting a good SOP is as much about structure as substance. Members of the admissions committee are busy, reviewing applications while also researching, teaching, and advising. Help them understand who you are, what you’re proposing, and why it matters, quickly and clearly. (This book by Rogers and Lasky-Fink offers helpful guidance on how to do that.)\nThere’s a loose but reliable structure that most SOPs follow:\n\nHook: A personal or intellectual moment that motivates your research interest.\nGap: A puzzle or tension in the literature you want to address.\nDesign: How you plan to tackle it: your research question, approach, or early ideas.\nQualifications: What experiences have prepared you to do this work.\nFit: Why this program, and what you hope to learn from it.\n\nThink of it like a well-crafted pitch. By the end, the committee shouldn’t just think you’re smart or hardworking; every applicant is.\nThey should think: this person is working on a problem that matters, and our department can help them do it well.\n3. Don’t write like you’re trying to impress: write like you’re trying to connect\nAvoid the temptation to overuse technical jargon. You’re not writing to prove how much you know. You’re writing to show what kind of researcher you’re becoming. And the most effective researchers are often the clearest communicators.\nWrite like a journalist, not a lawyer. Assume your reader is an intelligent, curious upper-level undergraduate: they’re sharp, but not steeped in the specifics of your subfield. Signal expertise through clarity, not complexity. Jargon isn’t a sin, but if it gets in the way of your argument, it’s not helping you.\nThe best SOPs are accessible, focused, and grounded in real curiosity.\nThey don’t beg to be taken seriously; they make it easy to do so.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "What Running Taught Me: How to Fail and How to Grow Old",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Starting Over\nIn early 2020, I took up running seriously. Before that, I had been a martial arts enthusiast, training in Taekwondo and Wushu at Berkeley, and a regular at the gym. But once my first child was born, those habits quietly slipped away. I didn’t have the time, energy, or flexibility anymore.\nThen the pandemic hit. Like many others, I suddenly found myself with a new rhythm of life. My long commutes disappeared, and I decided to reclaim that time by lacing up my shoes and heading out for a run.\nAt first, I approached running the way I approached my work: with structure, intensity, and goal-setting. I tracked my pace, set mileage targets, and pushed myself to improve. But over time, and with many sore muscles and unmet goals, I began to let go of that mindset. I stopped chasing numbers. I started running for how it made me feel.\nRunning as Meditation\nThese days, I run four to five times a week, usually covering 10 to 15 kilometers (around 6 to 9 miles). I’m not fast, and my form isn’t graceful. But I run anyway. Because I’ve learned that none of that matters.\nRunning calms my mind. It gives my thoughts a place to go. When I focus on my breath, the rhythm of my steps, and the steady beat of my heart, I find something rare: quiet. A kind of stillness I don’t often experience in the rest of my day. What began as a form of exercise has become something else entirely: a moving meditation.\nAnd in that meditative space, I’ve learned how to fail. And how to grow old.\nLearning How to Fail\nResearch, especially academic research, is built on failure. Every researcher knows this, but that doesn’t make it easier. From the first days of graduate school, I’ve faced rejection: papers, grants, jobs. Each one stings. But over time, I’ve learned something that running helped crystallize: to grow, you have to take risks. And to take risks, you have to accept failure.\nWhen I first started running, I set goals that mimicked the metrics of success in my professional life: speed and distance. But the more I pushed myself to meet those metrics, the less joy I found.\nNow, when I run, I don’t worry about how fast or far I go. I focus on the experience: breathing well, landing lightly, staying present. If I run slower today than yesterday, that’s okay. I’ll run again tomorrow. The same lesson applies to work. I still set goals. But once I’m working, I don’t obsess over outcomes. I focus on process, on learning, on flow.\nAs Haruki Murakami wrote in his running memoir, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, the goal is to keep going day after day, with purpose and humility. That’s how I’ve learned to fail. And to keep moving.\nLearning How to Grow Old\nThe other lesson running has taught me is how to age, not passively, but deliberately.\nAs much as I loved martial arts, it started taking a toll. I got injured more easily. Recovery took longer. I found myself wondering if I could keep pushing my body the same way I had in my twenties. The honest answer was no.\nBut instead of resisting the inevitable, I started adapting. Running became a new kind of practice, one that matched the season of life I was entering. I don’t train to compete. I run to stay connected to my body. To feel my lungs expand and my feet lift off the ground. To remind myself that I’m still here, still learning, still alive.\nI ran my first official half marathon at the San Francisco Marathon in 2021. In 2024, I ran the Berkeley Half Marathon during the academic job market, no less. In 2025, I’ll run my first full marathon, back where it started: San Francisco.\nSince 2020, I’ve run nearly everywhere I’ve lived or traveled, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe, Honolulu, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and in South Korea, Seoul, Sejong, and Daejeon. In Canada, I’ve run in both Montreal, Quebec and Vancouver, British Columbia, on opposite coasts.\nEach run etched something into my memory and left something in my body. Between official races, I’ve kept going, including many self-paced half marathons and more than a few beyond the half mark.\nThe Road Ahead\nRunning didn’t just give me a new habit. I’ve learned to let go of perfection. I’ve learned that failure isn’t a detour; It’s part of the path. I’ve learned that aging isn’t something to fight, but something to navigate with care.\nAs long as my legs can carry me, I’ll keep running. I’ll keep working. I’ll keep finding joy in the rhythm of small, deliberate steps, on the road and in life.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "My tastes have changed a lot over the years. There are many things I used to like that I don’t anymore. But one thing has remained constant: I’m still a devoted fan of Haruki Murakami, the prolific Japanese novelist whose work blends myth and realism to capture the quiet rhythms and alienation of modern life.\nIn Norwegian Wood, Murakami writes through the voice of Nagasawa to Watanabe, “Well, any friend of Gatsby is a friend of mine.” In the original Japanese, the line is: 『グレート・ギャツビイ』を 三回読む男なら、俺と友だちになれそうだな (Anyone who read The Great Gatsby three times, I feel like I could be friends with him).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line marks the beginning of an unlikely friendship. Watanabe first read The Great Gatsby at eighteen, but no one around him shared the same interest until he meets Nagasawa, the only person he knows who’s read it. They couldn’t be more different: Watanabe is quiet and solitary; Nagasawa is confident and headed for the elite world. Still, they find common ground in Fitzgerald. Murakami himself has a deep appreciation for Fitzgerald’s work and has translated several of his novels into Japanese.\n\n\n\nI feel the same way about Murakami’s running memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, a title that playfully nods to Raymond Carver’s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Anyone who has read this particular Haruki book three times, I have a feeling we’d get along.\nIn the memoir, Murakami reflects on two central aspects of his life: writing and running. For him, the two are deeply connected. He explains how becoming a professional writer meant completely reinventing his lifestyle, including when he wakes up, how he works, what hobbies he enjoys, where he lives, and who he spends time with. After returning to this book again and again, I’ve come to hold onto three lessons that continue to shape how I think about talent, focus, and everyday discipline.\n\n1. “I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more.” (Haruki Murakami)\n\nThis principle runs counter to how many of us are tempted to work. When things are going well, it’s easy to keep going and chase the short-term satisfaction of crossing something off the list. But Murakami urges the opposite: stop while you’re still in flow. That way, you preserve energy and motivation for the next day.\nTrying to do too much, too fast, is a surefire path to burnout. As Murakami puts it, “To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. That is the important thing for long-term projects.” And in academia, every project is a long-term project. Early in my career, I used to believe some ideas could be wrapped up in a few months. I no longer believe that. What I’ve learned instead is that finishing well requires knowing when to pause, how to conserve energy, and how to stay steady over time.\n\n2. “I’m struck by how, except when you’re young, you really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance.” (Haruki Murakami)\n\nMurakami writes that talent is the most important quality for a novelist, but it’s also unreliable: “Talent has a mind of its own and wells up when it wants to, and once it dries up, that’s it.” Not only is talent unevenly distributed; it can also disappear.\nThat’s why, he says, the second most important quality is “focus, the ability to concentrate all your limited talents on whatever’s critical at the moment.” For Murakami, that means waking up early and writing for three or four hours each morning. “I don’t see anything else. I don’t think about anything else.” Without that kind of focus, nothing meaningful gets done.\nBut focus, as Murakami describes it, isn’t just about maintaining distraction-free work hours. It’s also about knowing what not to pursue. He reminds us that you can’t please everyone. When he ran a bar, where he wrote his first novel at the kitchen table, he realized that if one out of ten customers liked the place enough to come back, that was enough. “It didn’t matter if nine out of ten didn’t like my bar. This realization lifted a weight off my shoulders.” What mattered was being clear about his stance and sticking to it.\nThe same applies to creative pursuits, including academic ones. What matters is knowing what you want to focus on, working on it consistently, and reaching the people who matter to you. You can’t do everything or reach everyone. Focus doesn’t come from grinding harder; it comes from letting go of what’s not essential. You need to know where to invest your time, how to channel your abilities, and what goals are truly worth pursuing.\n\n3. “If concentration is the process of just holding your breath, endurance is the art of slowly, quietly breathing at the same time you’re storing air in your lungs.” (Haruki Murakami)\n\nThis third lesson is about rhythm, about knowing when to push and when to pause. Murakami continues, “Unless you can find a balance between both, it’s difficult to write novels professionally over a long time. Continuing to breathe while you hold your breath.” To endure as a writer, or any kind of creative, means learning to resist extremes. That’s what makes you a good contrarian.\nSometimes, you need to push through discomfort. Other times, you need to slow down, listen to your body, and adjust. The goal isn’t balance in the abstract; it’s rhythm, a pace that isn’t too fast or too slow, one that adapts to your needs over time.\nAnd finding that rhythm often requires building routines or rituals, ways to remind yourself how to return to it.\nFor me, that means running, hiking, and cooking. Running helps me sync my mind and body. Hiking reminds me I’m part of nature. Cooking connects me with the seasons I observed and experienced when I was young, and brings back childhood memories of a home that is, quite literally, an ocean away.\nThere’s no single right way to recover, but we all need one. There’s a quiet kind of pain in how we face uncertainty and rejection in academia. Sometimes, even doing well can be harmful if we don’t know how to stop and take care of ourselves. Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. And to make that suffering optional, we need to know when to push, but also when to pause, reflect, and recharge so that we can keep going.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "What I Wish I Knew Before the Academic Job Market",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I first entered the academic job market in the U.S., in my fifth year of graduate school, I revised my materials, practiced my job talk, followed every checklist, but I wasn’t sure what would actually matter. Like many others, I assumed it was about proving I was good enough.\nOver time, and with experience, I came to see things differently. The job market isn’t just about being the strongest candidate. It’s about fit, timing, and clarity. These are a few lessons I wish someone had shared with me earlier.\nUnderstanding the Process Helps, but It Won’t Explain Everything\nThe academic job market can feel like a black box. In reality, it’s a long, uneven process. The Berkeley Career Center explains it well: departments typically request permission to hire in the spring, post job ads in the fall, interview in the winter, and extend offers in the spring, though it rarely runs smoothly.\nEven the job ad can be misleading. It’s often a compromise between faculty interests and administrative approval. It may not reflect a unified vision or clear priorities. That’s why you shouldn’t dismiss an opportunity just because you don’t fit the ad perfectly. Your job is to make the case for how your work fits, on your terms.\n1. Fit matters, and it’s not something you can force.\nThe job market is a two-way street. Departments are looking for candidates who fit their needs, but you’re also looking for a place that fits you. It’s not just about the job description; it’s about the culture, the people, and the values of the department.\nNo one has a complete picture of what a department is like from the outside. That’s why it’s important to ask questions, to a lot of people. If you attend a conference or visit a campus, seek out informal conversations. Reach out to people whose work you admire. Read their papers, ask thoughtful questions, and follow up. These small gestures can build trust, and sometimes open doors.\nMany candidates think the market is a straight competition. But departments aren’t always hiring “the best” candidate in the abstract. They’re hiring the person whose work, teaching, and trajectory align with their evolving needs.\nThat’s why clarity is so important. Your materials should make it easy to see how your work connects to what the department values.\nNot all departments or professional schools want the same things. Some prioritize theory and publications; others value applied relevance or interdisciplinary work. Even within fields, expectations vary.\nYou don’t need to change who you are. Focus instead on finding an environment where you can grow into the scholar and colleague you want to be. The job market is partly about being chosen, but also about choosing well.\n2. Define your direction, clearly, but with room to grow.\nOne thing that helps: write down your research in a single sentence. Not just the topic, but the question, and what you’re trying to understand about the world. Clear, simple language is better than buzzwords.\nThat sentence will anchor your job talk, research statement, and cover letter. It helps committees remember you.\nBut the job market isn’t just about your present. Committees want to know where you’re headed. What questions will guide your next projects? How will your research evolve over the next few years? They’re assessing your pipeline: your ability to sustain a coherent and growing scholarly agenda.\nThink, too, about alignment. Where does your research direction intersect with the department’s and school’s broader vision? Where could you find not just a place to land, but momentum to grow? You don’t need all the answers. But showing that you’ve thought ahead goes a long way.\n3. Conversations, Not Auditions\nJob talks, 1:1 meetings, and group meetings are all part of an extended conversation. It’s all about showing how you think, listen, and engage in real time.\nThink of it as jazz; you don’t control the setting, but you can improvise with care and attentiveness.\nThe job talk, in particular, is high-stakes. It probably won’t win you the job outright, but it can certainly lose it. Committees are looking for clarity, coherence, and the ability to communicate beyond your subfield. A poor talk can be disqualifying, even if everything else looks strong. The Q&A often matters as much as the presentation itself. It reveals how you handle feedback and interact with others, a glimpse of you as a colleague.\nAnd when someone asks if you have questions, take it seriously. Thoughtful questions show that you’ve imagined yourself in the role. What kind of mentorship do junior faculty receive? What directions is the department hoping to grow in? What do they hope this new hire will help build? These conversations reveal as much about them as they do about you, because the people you’re talking to are not just evaluating you; they are your potential future colleagues. Treat these moments as the beginning of a professional relationship. Be curious, engaged, and respectful.\nIf You’re Going on the Market\nEveryone’s job market story is different. Some people get lucky quickly. Others take longer. And sometimes even the best-prepared candidates don’t get the outcome they hoped for. Part of this depends on the structure of your dissertation, whether it’s designed as a three-paper project or a book, and whether you’re fortunate enough to publish a chapter in a top journal before going on the market. Some of these factors are within your control. Others aren’t. Especially if you’re going on the market as an ABD, your advisor’s letters matter a great deal. Strong, specific letters from your dissertation committee can shape how hiring departments view your potential and help offset aspects of your work that are still in progress.\nWhat helped me was shifting the question, from “Am I good enough?” to “Where do I want to grow next, and with whom?” What matters most isn’t perfection. It’s having a clear vision, a trajectory you believe in, and enough momentum to keep moving forward.\nYou won’t be the right fit everywhere. That’s okay. You only need one place where your work resonates and where you can continue to grow.\nI’m still learning. But if you’re preparing now, I hope this gives you a bit more confidence, and a little peace of mind. Build your community of mentors and supporters, and lean on them. The process is easier, and more rewarding, when you’re not doing it alone.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Some memories fade as we grow older; others come into sharper focus. As my late father’s memorial day approaches, one conversation remains crystal clear: the one I had with him on my wedding day.\nIt was a few hours before the ceremony. We were sitting side by side in a hair salon, the stylist adding a final touch to my hair while rain slid down the window, when he began to speak. He told me, again, how my grandfather had forbidden him to attend college because, as the youngest son, he was expected to stay close to home. My father had been so frail that my grandfather even renamed him Myungryul, meaning “long life,” hoping the new characters would protect him.\nHe mounted a quiet rebellion, choosing numbers and circuits over rows of crops and spending thirty-two years as an electrician in a paper mill. It was one of the few outlets for his talent. In doing so, he escaped the rural life he was born into, but not the hardships etched into his path. Factory floors in Korea then were unforgiving: the pounding machines slowly stole hearing in one ear, and decades of dust and chemical haze, his likely suspects since he neither smoked nor drank, may have seeded the cancer that would eventually take his life.\nWhen we talked that rainy morning, I had graduated from college and was working at a software start-up. Tech circles claimed they would “revolutionize” the world, while most products really just chased a few extra ad clicks. The louder the talk grew, the more skeptical I became. I wanted to answer even a single question properly, and that meant learning how to do research. Graduate school felt remote to someone from a working-class family, yet I applied for and received the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies scholarship, one of the most prestigious and competitive fellowships in Korea, awarded that year to only two political science students to support their PhD studies abroad.\nMy father was excited about the news and about my marriage to my girlfriend, a year older and already thriving in an engineering career he himself might have loved. In us, he saw the opportunities he had once dreamed of: in me, an education reaching beyond the farm and factory floor; in her, a career shaped by mathematical skill and a passion for engineering.\nHe often said his greatest regret was letting his dream slip away and that he had no fixed plan for my career, only the hope I would follow my own path. I remember that conversation not just because of the rain’s hush, but because it was almost our last real talk. A few months later, cancer took him.\nI moved to the United States and earned a PhD in political science at UC Berkeley. We hadn’t always seen eye to eye, but I dedicated my dissertation to him, hoping he might somehow know his sacrifices were acknowledged. After completing my degree, I began my career as a researcher and data scientist, always mindful of the path that brought me here. Today I’m often surrounded by people whose backgrounds rarely resemble mine, but I’ve never forgotten my father, our conversation on that rainy morning, or the dream he was never able to pursue.\nIt has been more than ten years since he passed away. I can no longer clearly recall his face or the exact sound of his voice. But I remember that conversation: the pain I felt, the sorrow I saw, and the regret I heard. That memory stays with me, sharper than any photograph, and it shapes the work I do.\nResearch is powered by curiosity, theory, and data, but for me it is also anchored in mission. That mission is personal: to stay with the hard, determined work of adding even a small measure of dignity for people like my father, people who rarely set foot on a college campus, who celebrated their children’s chances while quietly carrying the weight of doors closed to them.\nWhile studying poverty and inequality in the U.S., my adopted home, I saw their struggles firsthand, spoke with them directly, listened to their stories, and learned from them, each one a reminder of my father.\nNot everyone will sit in university lecture halls, but everyone deserves research that begins with their lives, listens to their stories, and, above all, serves them.\n\n\n\nMy father donated his body to Korea University Medical School (my alma mater). Given that he grew up in a Confucian family, this was both an act of rebellion against his upbringing and a final act of service to others. Whenever I visit South Korea, I make a point to stop by the Korea University campus, not only to catch up with my teachers and friends who are now faculty there, but also to visit my father’s memorial site. It is marked by the Tower of Gratitude (shown in the picture), a monument on the medical campus that hosts the annual Ceremony of Gratitude, held every April to honor body donors who have contributed to the advancement of medicine through their noble sacrifice.

    "text": "A little over a year into my data science role outside academia, in spring 2024, I spoke on the “Data Science Across Industries” panel at the PhD Pathways event at Stanford. Ironically, the panel was designed to help PhD students and postdocs explore careers outside the academy, but for me, it triggered a return. I had spent the past year applying my research skills to public problems: designing field experiments with government partners, analyzing administrative data, and learning from people who navigated public systems every day. I believed in the work. I still do. But listening to early-career scholars talk about their hopes for impact, I felt something shift.\nI wasn’t done with academia. I just hadn’t found the version of it I believed in yet.\nIn 2022, I had left a tenure-track job to join Code for America, a civic tech nonprofit focused on improving access to public services through technology, design, and data. It was a leap. I didn’t fully know what to expect. But I wanted to learn how research could serve real people. Over the next two years, I helped build experiments with U.S. state and local governments, sat in on user interviews, and saw how broken public systems were. I also saw how much potential there was for research to do more than describe and analyze problems. It could help fix them.\nAt the time, I thought I was stepping away from academia for good. In reality, I was becoming a different kind of researcher, one more attuned to practical constraints, lived experience, and the institutional frictions that shape how policy is delivered.\nI learned new technical skills, yes, but I also learned how to work in multidisciplinary teams, how to frame questions that mattered beyond the academy, and how to generate evidence that was timely, usable, and grounded in context. The experience rewired how I think about rigor, relevance, and responsibility.\nStill, the decision to return wasn’t easy. That moment at Stanford made me confront it. Did I still belong in academia? Could I reconcile the intellectual freedom I valued with the applied, collaborative work I had grown to love?\nRather than returning to where I left off, I chose to carry what I’d learned with me. I began to imagine a different kind of academic life: one that connects rigorous scholarship with real-world impact, and that bridges research and practice to improve public institutions and better serve communities. In 2026, I’ll begin a position as an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. The opportunity to return wasn’t a reset. It was a reinvention.\nToo often, we present academic and non-academic paths as a binary. But that framing misses what’s happening at the intersections. Some of the most exciting work today, both intellectually and practically, is happening across sectors, in government, nonprofits, and industry, where researchers are advancing theory and solving problems at the same time.\nRather than asking where research happens, I’ve learned to ask what kind of research I want to do, and why it matters.\nPhD programs rarely teach us that stepping outside academia can strengthen our scholarship. In graduate school, I was trained to run a Michelin-starred kitchen: refined, precise, and optimized for a narrow audience. Outside academia, I learned to run a healthy fast-food franchise: fast, responsive, and designed to meet people where they are. Both forms of work require creativity and care, but the tools, audiences, and stakes are different.\nFor early-career researchers, the message too often is that once you leave, you can’t come back. But that’s not true. Some of the most meaningful research I’ve done happened outside the university, without the academic title, but with a clear research purpose. Leaving academia doesn’t mean leaving research. It can deepen it, offering a different vantage point shaped by institutional constraints, real-world complexity, and the lived experiences of the people your work is meant to serve. If anything, stepping outside can sharpen your sense of what questions matter, who they matter to, and how evidence can contribute to lasting change.\nWhat I’ve Learned\n\nYou don’t have to choose once and for all. Careers are nonlinear. The skills you build across domains can make you a better scholar, collaborator, and teacher.\nSeek alignment, not just prestige, and define success on your own terms. The right environment, whether inside or outside academia, should reflect your values and help you reconnect with why you became a researcher in the first place. Success might be a paper, a public dashboard, a field experiment, or a policy shift. If it helps people and moves your mission forward, it counts.\nResearch is portable. Stepping outside of academia doesn’t mean abandoning your identity as a researcher. It can sharpen your questions, broaden your perspective, and deepen your sense of what knowledge is for.\n\nHere’s the bigger lesson. In a time of rising skepticism toward research and higher education, the best way to defend scholarship is to make it matter. Connect it to the people and problems it’s meant to serve. We do that not by standing apart, but by stepping in.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
