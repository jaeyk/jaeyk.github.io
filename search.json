    "text": "The Desire to Learn and the Desire to Serve\nI wrote the following essay in early 2023 and revised it in December 2024.\nIn November 2022, I left my tenure-track position to work as a professional data scientist. When an academic friend of mine asked me how it feels to move to the “other side” and what led me to make that decision, I realized that even though I’ve left academia in some sense, I haven’t left research. I still conduct research, design surveys and experiments, check data quality, analyze various kinds of data, and disseminate findings. My data science team also collaborates with academics from time to time. In addition, Code for America is a policy-focused organization. Basically, I am doing (social) data science for disadvantaged people in the US. I also maintain my academic affiliation and have a group of researchers with whom I have collaborated for many years. We continue to work on shared projects.\nTherefore, I see this chapter in my life not so much as a transition, but as an expansion or fusion of the two worlds: the academic and applied fields. I have inhabited both for a long time, and I have simply changed the composition of my portfolio. My research has become more applied, and I have replaced teaching with meetings with stakeholders and team members. If I used to play solo ping-pong, I now play full-team soccer. To use another analogy, I used to dream of running a Michelin-starred restaurant, but now I think of building a healthy fast food franchise. Outside academia, we need to do good (or good enough) work that is effective (correct) but also cost-effective (doable).\nAfter graduating from college, my first job was as a product manager at a startup. I reported to CxOs, analyzed market opportunities and risks, and did a variety of other tasks because the firm was still small. Although the fast-paced and high-pressure environment was challenging, I enjoyed organizing chaotic situations and finding direction in uncertain circumstances. However, I felt dissatisfied. Occasionally, I needed to analyze internal and external data to create a market strategy, but I wasn’t sure if my analytical approach was correct. I lacked the necessary skills and perspectives. I wanted to be a researcher who could distinguish fact from fiction. That’s why I decided to go to graduate school.\nTo make a long story short, I was incredibly lucky to attend UC Berkeley for my Ph.D. training in political science with an external fellowship. It was a fantastic experience. Berkeley was the place I had always dreamed of, and the Bay Area provided educational and career opportunities for my wife, who happened to be an engineer.\nAfter nearly completing my dissertation, I began working as a researcher at the SNF Agora Institute and P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Although my job title has changed slightly, my role has remained consistent. I collaborate with team members and organizations in the field to develop data and tools that promote effective civic engagement.\nMy decision to pursue this line of work stems from two desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. In graduate school, I learned invaluable skills—from social science theories to statistical, computational, and mixed methods. But I also learned from my advisors, peers, and people from all walks of life that I can use those skills to make an impact by being useful to others. These two desires define my work and identity.\nBefore joining the Code for America, I was a tenure-track professor at a policy school in South Korea for about a year. This decision was complicated by my mother’s debilitating health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strict quarantine policies in Korea made finding a job there the only viable option for me to stay with my mom in the long term. In 2022, I traveled back and forth between the US and South Korea many times. As my mom’s health improved, I began to consider moving back to the US, where my wife, daughter (then only 4-years-old), close friends, and long-time colleagues are located. I was born in Korea but made in the US.\nReflecting on my career paths, I am grateful for their non-linear nature and for all the people I met along the way. I grew up in a semi-rural area in Korea where there was no library, and the only place to find books was a small bookstore. Despite reading almost all the available books, my hunger for knowledge only grew. My graduate school years were some of the best years of my life, as I was happy to learn from leading experts and develop my own intellectual identity.\nNevertheless, I have never forgotten my roots. Both my wife and I come from working-class families, lost a parent early, and fought countless uphill battles. A stroke of incredible luck and the generosity of many people put me on the path I am on today.\nTherefore, I have been thinking about how to best use my time and energy to serve people, even while writing my dissertation. From this perspective, the transition I made in late 2022 was not a transition but rather the continuation of my life journey.\nI understand that in life, many paths are often beyond our control due to the unknown risks and opportunities we face. Even something as simple as sending my young daughter to school in the morning can be a challenge. Life is difficult because we rely on others to accomplish the things we want.\nTwo years after writing this essay, I returned to academia because I wanted to pursue my own research agenda. One year from now, I will begin my position as an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill after completing my multiple fellowships and ongoing applied projects. If someone were to ask me whether I had envisioned this future for myself, I would honestly say that I had no idea.\nAlthough I am uncertain about the future, I know that I am guided by two strong desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. These desires act as my North Star, and I am dedicated to following them regardless of the paths that may lie ahead of me.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Book projects\n\n“Unseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics.” (based on dissertation)\n\nInterviewed by Scope Conditions podcast\nWinner of the 2022 Best Dissertation Award, Urban and Local Politics, APSA\nWinner of the 2020 Best Paper Award, Asian Pacific American Politics, WPSA\nDatasets: Asian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service Organizations Dataset (1868-2016)\n\n\nUnseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics develops a new theory of racial group formation by examining how immigrant-origin communities responded to their exclusion from federal classification systems—particularly during the War on Poverty. These exclusionary practices were not merely symbolic; they had material consequences, shaping access to public resources and political recognition. While classification decisions were made at the federal level, they were felt most acutely at the local level—through everyday interactions with street-level bureaucrats who implemented social policy. These encounters often determined whether individuals and communities were seen, counted, and served.\nIn response, ethnic elites engaged in political innovation: they coined new panethnic labels, formed cross-ethnic coalitions, and founded civic organizations to make their communities legible to the state. Though these efforts were locally grounded, they scaled upward. Over time, the categories and claims forged in neighborhoods and community institutions began to influence how government agencies enumerated populations and administered benefits. These bottom-up innovations ultimately helped reshape the very bureaucratic systems that had once excluded them.\nThe book draws on original archival research, a dataset of over 800 ethnic organizations, and computational analysis of 78,000 articles from ethnic newspapers. Through comparative analysis across cities, racial groups, and national contexts—including U.S.–Canada, Asian–Latino, and Asian–Black comparisons—it demonstrates that panethnic identities did not emerge from shared culture or inherent solidarity. Instead, they were the product of strategic adaptation to the bureaucratic logics and incentive structures of the modern state.\nBy foregrounding the politics of classification and the local implementation of federal policy, Unseen and Uncounted reframes panethnic formation as a historically contingent, politically driven process. The book contributes to ongoing debates in political science, sociology, public administration, and history, offering new insight into how racial categories are constructed, contested, and institutionalized in American political development.\nUniversity presses specializing in American politics and public policy are warmly encouraged to reach out to discuss this book project further. I look forward to engaging with publishers committed to rigorous, interdisciplinary scholarship in these areas.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

Written by social data scientist and public interest technologist Jae Yeon Kim, the book draws on real-world policy examples from the U.S. and South Korea to show how government data systems shape who gets access to benefits, who gets heard, and who gets left behind. Across ten clear and accessible chapters, Kim offers a roadmap for building a more equitable, citizen-centered digital state. From improving public service interfaces to training the next generation of civic data scientists, this book reimagines public data not just as infrastructure, but as a foundation for stronger democracy and better government.\n\nImpact & Recognition\n\nSelected as one of 70 finalists by the Korean Government in the popular social science category for 2024; the government purchased approximately 500 copies and distributed them to public libraries nationwide\nRecommended by the National Assembly Library, Samsung Global Research’s executive education program (SERICEO), and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)\nFeatured in major Korean newspapers across the ideological spectrum:\nThe Chosun Ilbo,\nMaeil Business Newspaper,\nThe Korea Economic Daily,\nKyunghyang Shinmun,\nHankyoreh\nRegular op-eds based on the book published in:\nChosun Ilbo’s Civic Section (a major conservative newspaper) and\nWeekly Kyunghang (a major liberal magazine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Scheduled Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)\nThe Politics of Public Policy\nPublic policy does not end with the passage of legislation. While policy design often attracts the most attention, the implementation phase—where political decisions are translated into administrative action—frequently unfolds in relative silence. This course seeks to unveil that curtain. It examines how power, institutions, and political behavior shape the ways policies are interpreted, delivered, and experienced in practice.\nStudents analyze three interrelated dimensions of policy implementation:\n\nInstitutional structures, including federalism, separation of powers, and administrative procedures\nPolitical behavior, such as public opinion and media frames\n\nOrganizational influences, including bureaucratic discretion, frontline decision-making, and administrative capacity\n\nThe course also explores how policies generate feedback effects—altering patterns of political participation, reinforcing or challenging institutional arrangements, and shaping future implementation practices.\nThe course adapts to different levels of study:\n\nFor undergraduates, it introduces key concepts and real-world cases that reveal the political significance of implementation.\n\nFor Master of Public Policy (MPP) students, it emphasizes applied analysis and equips students with conceptual tools to assess and navigate implementation challenges.\n\nFor PhD students, the course engages with theoretical and empirical literature on policy feedback, institutional development, and street-level governance. Doctoral students are expected to develop original research questions and contribute to scholarly debates on the politics of implementation.\n\n\n\nPotential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)\nThese three courses form an integrated sequence in public policy data science, preparing students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data, computation, and artificial intelligence in the policy process. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance—from causal inference and algorithmic decision-making to digital service delivery and practitioner collaboration. Together, they equip students with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data- and AI-driven solutions to public problems.\n\nData, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy\n\nThis course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and machine learning models are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. Particular attention is given to the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including issues of opacity, bias, and institutional accountability. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with the goals and constraints of public governance.\n\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service\n\nThis course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms—such as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI-powered tools—in shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery, including transparency, user autonomy, and algorithmic accountability. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to enhance—not replace—human judgment, trust, and inclusion in public programs.\n\nEvidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact\n\nThis course examines how data scientists and policy researchers can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses—including field experiments and operational evaluations—and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative production and use of evidence for public impact.\n\n\nCourses Taught (UC Berkeley, KDI School, etc)\n\nGraduate Seminars\n\nKDI School of Public Policy and Management\n\nR Fundamentals for Public Policy (Spring 2022, Fall 2022)\nData Visualization and Communication (Summer 2022)\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nIntroduction to Computational Tools for Social Science\n\nInstructor of record: Spring 2019, Spring 2021\n\nGraduate Student Instructor (GSI): Fall 2016 (with Rachel Bernhard)\n\nDigital Data Collection Workshop (Fall 2020, with Nick Kuipers)\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Lectures\n\nIntroduction to Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Methods (UC Berkeley, Fall 2016)\n\nGSI for Laura Stoker\n\nOutstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-conference Tutorials\n\nIC2S2 (2024): Training CSS PhDs for Academic & Non-Academic Careers\nSICSS-Howard (2021): R Bootcamp – Invited Instructor\n\n\n\nWorkshops (Selected)\n\nSummer Institute in Migration Research Methods, UC Berkeley (2024) – Invited Instructor\n\nDigital Data Collection, Korea University (2022) – Invited Instructor\n\nUC Berkeley D-Lab (2020–2021):\n\nFairness and Bias in Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning in R\n\nSQL for R Users\n\nFunctional Programming in R\n\nR Package Development\n\nAdvanced Data Wrangling\n\nProject Management in R\n\nR Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\nGuest Lectures (Selected)\n\n2025 – Johns Hopkins: NLP for CSS\n\n2024 – Johns Hopkins: Democracy by the Numbers\n\n2023 – Wesleyan: Democracy in East Asia\n\n2022 – National University of Singapore, KAIST, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University\n\n2021 – KAIST, Dartmouth\n\n\n\nPedagogical Publications and Resources\n\nTextbook: Computational Thinking for Social Scientists\n\nArticle: Teaching Computational Social Science for All, PS: Political Science & Politics (2022)\n\nPDF views: 911 | HTML views: 1,204 (as of October 31, 2024)\n\nCo-authored with Margaret Ng\n\nArticle: Training CSS PhDs for Academic and Non-Academic Careers, PS: Political Science & Politics (2024)\n\nPDF views: 1,471 | HTML views: 5,140 (as of October 31, 2024)\n\nIC2S2 2024 Slides\n\nIC2S2 2024 Tutorial site\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightening talk on teaching computational social science.
