I have designed and taught four graduate-level courses on computational social science and received the Best Graduate Student Instructor Award for teaching research design and quantitative methods from UC Berkeley. I have co-authored two articles on teaching computational social science and preparing students for diverse careers in data science. I have also been invited to write a book chapter on teaching computational social science, which is co-edited by Matti Nelimarkka (University of Helsinki) and Friedolin Merhout (University of Copenhagen) and is under contract with Edward Elgar Publishing.\nAs a mentor, I am committed to providing opportunities for historically underrepresented students. Since 2018, I have mentored twelve undergraduate and two graduate students of color in social sciences and STEM fields, 75% of whom are female. Many of these students have gone on to have successful careers in tech, finance, bio, consulting, and the public sector.\nAs a faculty member, I will continue to advocate for equity, diversity, and inclusion in academia and beyond through my research, teaching, and mentoring. I am eager to participate actively in groups that support students of color, international students, and first-generation college students."

    "text": "Potential future teaching\n\nThe Politics of Public Policy: This course prepares students to understand the political contexts in which policies are formulated and implemented. We focus on three specific contexts: institutional, behavioral, and organizational. These include political institutions (e.g., the separation of powers, federalism, and decentralization), political behavior (e.g., the media and the mass public), and political organizations (e.g., bureaucracy).\nPublic Policy Making: This course prepares students to understand how policy is formulated, implemented, and evaluated within the context of competing political frames, groups/stakeholders, and their interests. We will analyze this process through five specific policy case studies: housing, education, immigration, poverty and inequality, and criminal justice.\nU.S. Social Policy: This course prepares students to understand the historical development and contemporary politics surrounding social policy in the United States. It pays particular attention to implementing safety net programs and examines the strengths and limitations of policy innovations designed to address these issues.\nData Science for Public Policy: This course is designed to help students develop both computational and communication skills to transform data into compelling, fact-based arguments that can be used in policy design, implementation, and evaluation. The first half of the course focuses on building computational skills necessary for wrangling, modeling, and visualizing large, complex, and often messy datasets. In the second half, students will apply these skills to create data-driven policy products, such as six-page policy briefs.\nData and Algorithms for Public Policy: This course prepares students to understand how policies are designed and implemented through the interaction of data and algorithms. We first distinguish between the hype and reality of using data and algorithms across various public policy domains, ranging from social policy to criminal justice, underscoring their positive and negative human consequences. We then discuss how we can use these tools fairly, transparently, and responsibly through effective institutional and organizational design.\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service: This course prepares students to understand how technology, design, and data transform public services. Increasingly, citizens interact with government agencies through digital platforms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, etc.). We examine how human decisions create these “tech” products within specific institutional and organizational contexts. We then discuss “civic” tech approaches: design thinking-guided and data-driven methods to reduce administrative burdens in these policy experiences and improve policy access, processes, and outcomes."

The rising numbers of Asian Americans and Latinos are the main drivers of this change. However, the political power of these groups will only grow if there is unity among their members.\nContrary to conventional wisdom, the book argues that racial discrimination is not sufficient to explain when in-group solidarity emerges among minoritized populations. Despite the racial hierarchy in the United States, ethnic groups who have experienced discrimination have not always united politically. Before the late 1960s, national origin groups from Asia and Latin America did not come together as Asian Americans and Latinos. Their political strategy shifted during this historical juncture because of the policy changes. Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty programs expanded the American welfare state; however, these new safety net programs were implemented within the existing biracial framework. Street-level bureaucrats faced difficulty in classifying disadvantaged ethnic groups that did not fit into this prevalent image of the minority group. In response, non-target groups solved this collective problem by reinventing and organizing themselves in racial terms.\nThis book traces this origin story by examining the parallel emergence of Asian American and Latino community organizing, which preceded their electoral politics. It also assesses the argument’s scope conditions by comparing the variations in interethnic coalition formation in Chinatowns across the U.S. and Canadian border. Finally, it identifies the limitations of this contingent solidarity theory in the contemporary period of racial threats, awakenings, and underlying demographic changes.\nThe book connects scholarship on racial and ethnic politics, urban and local politics, policy implementation, community organizing, and political behavior from historical and comparative perspectives. The mix of original archival, organizational, survey, and experimental data deepens our understanding of how groups form and acquire political power in American politics and public policy.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

My research has been published in top outlets such as Nature Human Behaviour and received the Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics (2022) and the Civic Emerging Scholar Award (2024) from the American Political Science Association.\nI am a computational political scientist focusing on urban, social, and tech policy in the United States. Specifically, I use computational approaches to study (1) state capacity in policy implementation and (2) civic capacity in offline and online spaces. My recent projects seek to identify and reduce administrative burdens in U.S. safety net programs. To achieve this goal, I utilize human-centered design, field experimentation, and surveys, collaborating with state and local governments and nonprofits. My research has been made possible by generous support from the Russell Sage Foundation, Blum Initiative for Global and Regional Poverty Studies, National Research Foundation of Korea, Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and UC Berkeley.\nIn addition to my substantive interests, through my work on computational social science and data science pedagogy, I am actively engaged in bridging social sciences and data science and making computational methods accessible. I serve on the Advisory Board of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science and co-organized its first partner locations in the San Francisco Bay Area and South Korea. I also helped create South Korea’s first policy-focused data science graduate program while I was a faculty member at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management.\nBefore attending graduate school, I worked as a product manager at a software startup and was the youngest member of the Advisory Board of the largest internet company in South Korea.\nI am on the job market in the 2024-2025 academic year.\nYou can reach me at jkim638@jhu.edu.\nHere is a link to my CV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
