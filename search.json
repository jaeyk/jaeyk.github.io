    "text": "The Desire to Learn and the Desire to Serve\nI wrote the following essay in early 2023 and revised it in December 2024.\nIn November 2022, I left my tenure-track position to work as a professional data scientist. When an academic friend of mine asked me how it feels to move to the “other side” and what led me to make that decision, I realized that even though I’ve left academia in some sense, I haven’t left research. I still conduct research, design surveys and experiments, check data quality, analyze various kinds of data, and disseminate findings. My data science team also collaborates with academics from time to time. In addition, Code for America is a policy-focused organization. Basically, I am doing (social) data science for disadvantaged people in the US. I also maintain my academic affiliation and have a group of researchers with whom I have collaborated for many years. We continue to work on shared projects.\nTherefore, I see this chapter in my life not so much as a transition, but as an expansion or fusion of the two worlds: the academic and applied fields. I have inhabited both for a long time, and I have simply changed the composition of my portfolio. My research has become more applied, and I have replaced teaching with meetings with stakeholders and team members. If I used to play solo ping-pong, I now play full-team soccer. To use another analogy, I used to dream of running a Michelin-starred restaurant, but now I think of building a healthy fast food franchise. Outside academia, we need to do good (or good enough) work that is effective (correct) but also cost-effective (doable).\nAfter graduating from college, my first job was as a product manager at a startup. I reported to CxOs, analyzed market opportunities and risks, and did a variety of other tasks because the firm was still small. Although the fast-paced and high-pressure environment was challenging, I enjoyed organizing chaotic situations and finding direction in uncertain circumstances. However, I felt dissatisfied. Occasionally, I needed to analyze internal and external data to create a market strategy, but I wasn’t sure if my analytical approach was correct. I lacked the necessary skills and perspectives. I wanted to be a researcher who could distinguish fact from fiction. That’s why I decided to go to graduate school.\nTo make a long story short, I was incredibly lucky to attend UC Berkeley for my Ph.D. training in political science with an external fellowship. It was a fantastic experience. Berkeley was the place I had always dreamed of, and the Bay Area provided educational and career opportunities for my wife, who happened to be an engineer.\nAfter nearly completing my dissertation, I began working as a researcher at the SNF Agora Institute and P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Although my job title has changed slightly, my role has remained consistent. I collaborate with team members and organizations in the field to develop data and tools that promote effective civic engagement.\nMy decision to pursue this line of work stems from two desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. In graduate school, I learned invaluable skills—from social science theories to statistical, computational, and mixed methods. But I also learned from my advisors, peers, and people from all walks of life that I can use those skills to make an impact by being useful to others. These two desires define my work and identity.\nBefore joining the Code for America, I was a tenure-track professor at a policy school in South Korea for about a year. This decision was complicated by my mother’s debilitating health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strict quarantine policies in Korea made finding a job there the only viable option for me to stay with my mom in the long term. In 2022, I traveled back and forth between the US and South Korea many times. As my mom’s health improved, I began to consider moving back to the US, where my wife, daughter (then only 4-years-old), close friends, and long-time colleagues are located. I was born in Korea but made in the US.\nReflecting on my career paths, I am grateful for their non-linear nature and for all the people I met along the way. I grew up in a semi-rural area in Korea where there was no library, and the only place to find books was a small bookstore. Despite reading almost all the available books, my hunger for knowledge only grew. My graduate school years were some of the best years of my life, as I was happy to learn from leading experts and develop my own intellectual identity.\nNevertheless, I have never forgotten my roots. Both my wife and I come from working-class families, lost a parent early, and fought countless uphill battles. A stroke of incredible luck and the generosity of many people put me on the path I am on today.\nTherefore, I have been thinking about how to best use my time and energy to serve people, even while writing my dissertation. From this perspective, the transition I made in late 2022 was not a transition but rather the continuation of my life journey.\nI understand that in life, many paths are often beyond our control due to the unknown risks and opportunities we face. Even something as simple as sending my young daughter to school in the morning can be a challenge. Life is difficult because we rely on others to accomplish the things we want.\nTwo years after writing this essay, I returned to academia because I wanted to pursue my own research agenda. One year from now, I will begin my position as an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill after completing my multiple fellowships and ongoing applied projects. If someone were to ask me whether I had envisioned this future for myself, I would honestly say that I had no idea.\nAlthough I am uncertain about the future, I know that I am guided by two strong desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. These desires act as my North Star, and I am dedicated to following them regardless of the paths that may lie ahead of me.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "“Unseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics.” (based on dissertation)\n\nInterviewed by Scope Conditions podcast\nWinner of the 2022 Best Dissertation Award, Urban and Local Politics, APSA\nWinner of the 2020 Best Paper Award, Asian Pacific American Politics, WPSA\nDatasets: Asian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service Organizations Dataset (1868-2016)\n\n\nUnseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics develops a new theory of racial group formation by examining how immigrant-origin communities responded to their exclusion from federal classification systems—particularly during the War on Poverty. These exclusionary practices were not merely symbolic; they had material consequences, shaping access to public resources and political recognition. While classification decisions were made at the federal level, they were felt most acutely at the local level—through everyday interactions with street-level bureaucrats who implemented social policy. These encounters often determined whether individuals and communities were seen, counted, and served.\nIn response, ethnic elites engaged in political innovation: they coined new panethnic labels, formed cross-ethnic coalitions, and founded civic organizations to make their communities legible to the state. Though these efforts were locally grounded, they scaled upward. Over time, the categories and claims forged in neighborhoods and community institutions began to influence how government agencies enumerated populations and administered benefits. These bottom-up innovations ultimately helped reshape the very bureaucratic systems that had once excluded them.\nThe book draws on original archival research, a dataset of over 800 ethnic organizations, and computational analysis of 78,000 articles from ethnic newspapers. Through comparative analysis across cities, racial groups, and national contexts—including U.S.–Canada, Asian–Latino, and Asian–Black comparisons—it demonstrates that panethnic identities did not emerge from shared culture or inherent solidarity. Instead, they were the product of strategic adaptation to the bureaucratic logics and incentive structures of the modern state.\nBy foregrounding the politics of classification and the local implementation of federal policy, Unseen and Uncounted reframes panethnic formation as a historically contingent, politically driven process. The book contributes to ongoing debates in political science, sociology, public administration, and history, offering new insight into how racial categories are constructed, contested, and institutionalized in American political development.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

    "section": "Potential future teaching",
    "text": "Potential future teaching\n\nThe Politics of Public Policy: This course prepares students to understand the political contexts in which policies are formulated and implemented. We focus on three specific contexts: institutional, behavioral, and organizational. These include political institutions (e.g., the separation of powers, federalism, and decentralization), political behavior (e.g., the media and the mass public), and political organizations (e.g., bureaucracy).\nPublic Policy Making: This course prepares students to understand how policy is formulated, implemented, and evaluated within the context of competing political frames, groups/stakeholders, and their interests. We will analyze this process through five specific policy case studies: housing, education, immigration, poverty and inequality, and criminal justice.\nU.S. Social Policy: This course prepares students to understand the historical development and contemporary politics surrounding social policy in the United States. It pays particular attention to implementing safety net programs and examines the strengths and limitations of policy innovations designed to address these issues.\nData Science for Public Policy: This course is designed to help students develop both computational and communication skills to transform data into compelling, fact-based arguments that can be used in policy design, implementation, and evaluation. The first half of the course focuses on building computational skills necessary for wrangling, modeling, and visualizing large, complex, and often messy datasets. In the second half, students will apply these skills to create data-driven policy products, such as six-page policy briefs.\nData and Algorithms for Public Policy: This course prepares students to understand how policies are designed and implemented through the interaction of data and algorithms. We first distinguish between the hype and reality of using data and algorithms across various public policy domains, ranging from social policy to criminal justice, underscoring their positive and negative human consequences. We then discuss how we can use these tools fairly, transparently, and responsibly through effective institutional and organizational design.\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service: This course prepares students to understand how technology, design, and data transform public services. Increasingly, citizens interact with government agencies through digital platforms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, etc.). We examine how human decisions create these “tech” products within specific institutional and organizational contexts. We then discuss “civic” tech approaches: design thinking-guided and data-driven methods to reduce administrative burdens in these policy experiences and improve policy access, processes, and outcomes."
