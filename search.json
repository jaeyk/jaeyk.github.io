    "title": "I Didn’t Think I’d Return to Academia — Until I Saw What Was Missing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A little over a year into my data science role outside academia, in spring 2024, I spoke on the “Data Science Across Industries” panel at the PhD Pathways event at Stanford. Ironically, the panel was designed to help PhD students and postdocs explore careers outside the academy—but for me, it triggered a return. I had spent the past year applying my research skills to public problems—designing field experiments with government partners, analyzing administrative data, and learning from people who navigated public systems every day. I believed in the work. I still do. But listening to early-career scholars talk about their hopes for impact, I felt something shift.\nI wasn’t done with academia. I just hadn’t found the version of it I believed in yet.\nIn 2022, I had left a tenure-track job to join Code for America, a civic tech nonprofit focused on improving access to public services through technology, design, and data. It was a leap. I didn’t fully know what to expect. But I wanted to learn how research could serve real people. Over the next two years, I helped build experiments with U.S. state and local governments, sat in on user interviews, and saw how broken public systems were—and how much potential there was for research to do more than describe and analyze problems. It could help fix them.\nAt the time, I thought I was stepping away from academia for good. In reality, I was becoming a different kind of researcher—one more attuned to practical constraints, lived experience, and the institutional frictions that shape how policy is delivered.\nI learned new technical skills, yes, but I also learned how to work in multidisciplinary teams, how to frame questions that mattered beyond the academy, and how to generate evidence that was timely, usable, and grounded in context. The experience rewired how I think about rigor, relevance, and responsibility.\nStill, the decision to return wasn’t easy. That moment at Stanford made me confront it. Did I still belong in academia? Could I reconcile the intellectual freedom I valued with the applied, collaborative work I had grown to love?\nRather than returning to where I left off, I chose to carry what I’d learned with me. I began to imagine a different kind of academic life—one that connects rigorous scholarship with real-world impact, and that bridges research and practice to improve public institutions and better serve communities. In 2026, I’ll begin a position as an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. The opportunity to return wasn’t a reset—it was a reinvention.\nToo often, we present academic and non-academic paths as a binary. But that framing misses what’s happening at the intersections. Some of the most exciting work today—both intellectually and practically—is happening across sectors: in government, nonprofits, and industry, where researchers are advancing theory and solving problems at the same time.\nRather than asking where research happens, I’ve learned to ask what kind of research I want to do—and why it matters.\nPhD programs rarely teach us that stepping outside academia can strengthen our scholarship. In graduate school, I was trained to run a Michelin-starred kitchen: refined, precise, and optimized for a narrow audience. Outside academia, I learned to run a healthy fast-food franchise: fast, responsive, and designed to meet people where they are. Both forms of work require creativity and care—but the tools, audiences, and stakes are different.\nFor early-career researchers, the message too often is: once you leave, you can’t come back. But that’s not true. Some of the most meaningful research I’ve done happened outside the university—without the academic title, but with a clear research purpose. Leaving academia doesn’t mean leaving research. It can deepen it, offering a different vantage point shaped by institutional constraints, real-world complexity, and the lived experiences of the people your work is meant to serve. If anything, stepping outside can sharpen your sense of what questions matter, who they matter to, and how evidence can contribute to lasting change.\nWhat I’ve Learned\n\nYou don’t have to choose once and for all. Careers are nonlinear. The skills you build across domains can make you a better scholar, collaborator, and teacher.\nSeek alignment, not just prestige, and define success on your own terms. The right environment—whether inside or outside academia—should reflect your values and help you reconnect with why you became a researcher in the first place. Success might be a paper, a public dashboard, a field experiment, or a policy shift. If it helps people and moves your mission forward, it counts.\nResearch is portable. Stepping outside of academia doesn’t mean abandoning your identity as a researcher. It can sharpen your questions, broaden your perspective, and deepen your sense of what knowledge is for.\n\nHere’s the bigger lesson. In a time of rising skepticism toward research and higher education, the best way to defend scholarship is to make it matter—to connect it to the people and problems it’s meant to serve. We do that not by standing apart, but by stepping in.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Scheduled Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)\nThe Politics of Public Policy\nPublic policy does not end with the passage of legislation. While policy design often attracts the most attention, the implementation phase—where political decisions are translated into administrative action—frequently unfolds in relative silence. This course seeks to unveil that curtain. It examines how political institutions, political behavior, and bureaucratic politics shape the ways policies are interpreted, delivered, and experienced in practice.\nBuilding on both classical and recent scholarship in political science and public administration, the course re-centers implementation as a political process. Rather than treating it as a technical afterthought, we explore how administrative burdens—the learning, compliance, and psychological costs of interacting with the state—are produced through a layered architecture of policy design, bureaucratic discretion, and frontline decision-making. This perspective highlights how implementation failures are not merely managerial breakdowns but reflect broader institutional and political dynamics.\nStudents analyze three interrelated dimensions of policy implementation:\n\nPolitical institutions, including federalism, separation of powers, and administrative procedures\n\nPolitical behavior, such as public opinion, policy framing, and participation\n\nBureaucratic politics, including agency discretion, frontline decision-making, and administrative capacity\n\nSpecial attention is paid to how inequality is reproduced or contested through everyday encounters with the state, and how implementation challenges can be addressed through better design, coordination, and accountability mechanisms.\nThe course adapts to different levels of study:\n\nFor undergraduates, it introduces foundational concepts and real-world cases that reveal the political significance of implementation. Case studies will draw on contemporary issues in health, welfare, education, and digital service delivery.\nFor Master of Public Policy (MPP) students, it emphasizes applied analysis and equips students with conceptual and diagnostic tools to assess and navigate implementation challenges across government systems.\nFor PhD students, the course engages deeply with theoretical and empirical literature on administrative burden, political institutions, and street-level governance. Doctoral students will use a macro–meso–micro framework to develop original research questions and contribute to scholarly debates on the politics of implementation.\n\n\n\nPotential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)\nThe following three courses form an integrated sequence in public policy data science, grounded in a domain-first approach. Rather than treating data science as a purely technical endeavor, the sequence begins with the policy problems themselves—emphasizing how data, computation, and artificial intelligence can be used in context to advance the public good. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance—from algorithmic decision-making to digital service delivery and researcher-practitioner collaboration. Together, they prepare students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data and AI in the policy process, equipping them with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data- and AI-driven solutions to public problems.\n\nData, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy\n\nThis course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and machine learning models are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. Particular attention is given to the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including issues of opacity, bias, and institutional accountability. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with the goals and constraints of public governance.\n\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service\n\nThis course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms—such as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI-powered tools—in shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery, including transparency, user autonomy, and algorithmic accountability. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to enhance—not replace—human judgment, trust, and inclusion in public programs.\n\nEvidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact\n\nThis course examines how data scientists and policy researchers can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses, and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative process and use of evidence for public impact.\n\n\nCourses Taught (UC Berkeley, KDI School, etc)\n\nGraduate Seminars\n\nKDI School of Public Policy and Management\n\nR Fundamentals for Public Policy (Spring 2022, Fall 2022)\nData Visualization and Communication (Summer 2022)\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nIntroduction to Computational Tools for Social Science\n\nInstructor of record: Spring 2019, Spring 2021\n\nGraduate Student Instructor (GSI): Fall 2016 (with Rachel Bernhard)\n\nDigital Data Collection Workshop (Fall 2020, with Nick Kuipers)\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Lectures\n\nIntroduction to Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Methods (UC Berkeley, Fall 2016)\n\nGSI for Laura Stoker\n\nOutstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-conference Tutorials\n\nIC2S2 (2024): Training CSS PhDs for Academic & Non-Academic Careers\nSICSS-Howard (2021): R Bootcamp – Invited Instructor\n\n\n\nWorkshops (Selected)\n\nSummer Institute in Migration Research Methods, UC Berkeley (2024) – Invited Instructor\n\nDigital Data Collection, Korea University (2022) – Invited Instructor\n\nUC Berkeley D-Lab (2020–2021):\n\nFairness and Bias in Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning in R\n\nSQL for R Users\n\nFunctional Programming in R\n\nR Package Development\n\nAdvanced Data Wrangling\n\nProject Management in R\n\nR Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\nGuest Lectures (Selected)\n\n2025 – Johns Hopkins: NLP for CSS\n\n2024 – Johns Hopkins: Democracy by the Numbers\n\n2023 – Wesleyan: Democracy in East Asia\n\n2022 – National University of Singapore, KAIST, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University\n\n2021 – KAIST, Dartmouth\n\n\n\nPedagogical Publications and Resources\n\nTextbook: Computational Thinking for Social Scientists\nAn open-access textbook (CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0) that equips social scientists with modern computational skills: reproducible workflows (Git, Bash, tidy data), functional programming in R, data product development, semi-structured data collection, high-dimensional text analysis (including NLP), predictive modeling, and database management with SQL.

    "text": "Book projects\n\n“Unseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics.” (based on dissertation)\n\nInterviewed by Scope Conditions podcast\nWinner of the 2022 Best Dissertation Award, Urban and Local Politics, APSA\nWinner of the 2020 Best Paper Award, Asian Pacific American Politics, WPSA\nDatasets: Asian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service Organizations Dataset (1868-2016)\n\n\nUnseen and Uncounted: Bureaucracy, Identity, and the Birth of Panethnic Politics develops a new theory of racial group formation by examining how immigrant-origin communities responded to their exclusion from federal classification systems—particularly during the War on Poverty. These exclusionary practices were not merely symbolic; they had material consequences, shaping access to public resources and political recognition. While classification decisions were made at the federal level, they were felt most acutely at the local level—through everyday interactions with street-level bureaucrats who implemented social policy. These encounters often determined whether individuals and communities were seen, counted, and served.\nIn response, ethnic elites engaged in political innovation: they coined new panethnic labels, formed cross-ethnic coalitions, and founded civic organizations to make their communities legible to the state. Though these efforts were locally grounded, they scaled upward. Over time, the categories and claims forged in neighborhoods and community institutions began to influence how government agencies enumerated populations and administered benefits. These bottom-up innovations ultimately helped reshape the very bureaucratic systems that had once excluded them.\nThe book draws on original archival research, a dataset of over 800 ethnic organizations, and computational analysis of 78,000 articles from ethnic newspapers. Through comparative analysis across cities, racial groups, and national contexts—including U.S.–Canada, Asian–Latino, and Asian–Black comparisons—it demonstrates that panethnic identities did not emerge from shared culture or inherent solidarity. Instead, they were the product of strategic adaptation to the bureaucratic logics and incentive structures of the modern state.\nBy foregrounding the politics of classification and the local implementation of federal policy, Unseen and Uncounted reframes panethnic formation as a historically contingent, politically driven process. The book contributes to ongoing debates in political science, sociology, public administration, and history, offering new insight into how racial categories are constructed, contested, and institutionalized in American political development.\nUniversity presses specializing in American politics and public policy are warmly encouraged to reach out to discuss this book project further. I look forward to engaging with publishers committed to rigorous, interdisciplinary scholarship in these areas.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

Written by social data scientist and public interest technologist Jae Yeon Kim, the book draws on real-world policy examples from the U.S. and South Korea to show how government data systems shape who gets access to benefits, who gets heard, and who gets left behind. Across ten clear and accessible chapters, Kim offers a roadmap for building a more equitable, citizen-centered digital state. From improving public service interfaces to training the next generation of civic data scientists, this book reimagines public data not just as infrastructure, but as a foundation for stronger democracy and better government.\n\nImpact & Recognition\n\nSelected as one of 70 finalists by the Korean Government in the popular social science category for 2024; the government purchased approximately 500 copies and distributed them to public libraries nationwide\nRecommended by the National Assembly Library, Samsung Global Research’s executive education program (SERICEO), and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)\nFeatured in major Korean newspapers across the ideological spectrum:\nThe Chosun Ilbo,\nMaeil Business Newspaper,\nThe Korea Economic Daily,\nKyunghyang Shinmun,\nHankyoreh\nRegular op-eds based on the book published in:\nChosun Ilbo’s Civic Section (a major conservative newspaper) and\nWeekly Kyunghang (a major liberal magazine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I develop and share public datasets to strengthen the empirical foundations of social science and expand access to knowledge for the public good.\n\nValidated Names for Experimental Studies on Ethnicity and Race\n\n\nSummary: A large and fast-growing number of studies across the social sciences use names in experiments to signal race. However, names may also convey other perceived attributes such as socioeconomic status and citizenship. This dataset provides the largest collection of validated name perceptions to date, based on three U.S. surveys. It includes 44,170 evaluations from 4,026 respondents for 600 names, with ratings of perceived race, income, education, and citizenship, along with respondent characteristics. These data are designed to help researchers isolate the causal effects of race in experimental research.\nUse case: Featured in our Nature Scientific Data paper.\n\nCollaborators: Joint work with Charles Crabtree, S. Michael Gaddis, John B. Holbein, Cameron Guage, and William Marx.\n\n\nLinked Fate Literature Review Dataset (1999–2019)\n\n\nSummary: A hand-coded dataset of published scholarship on linked fate in political science and related fields. It captures how the concept of linked fate has been defined, operationalized, and measured across 160 studies published between 1999 and 2019, including the populations studied and the theoretical frameworks used.\nUse case: Used in my review paper on linked fate with Reuel Rogers.\n\n\nAsian American and Latino Advocacy and Community Service Organizations Dataset (1868–2016)\n\n\nSummary: A historical dataset documenting over 600 nonprofit organizations serving Asian American and Latino communities across the U.S. from 1868 to 2016. It includes verified founding years, organizational types (advocacy, service, hybrid), and panethnic status. Special attention is given to organizations that gradually evolved from ethnic- to panethnic-focused missions, such as the National Council of La Raza (NCLR). Founding year is used as a proxy for panethnic transition due to limited archival data. To validate classification, each organization’s mission, programs, and target populations were verified using public websites and, where needed, news articles. Approximately 77% of Asian American and 71% of Latino organizations have validated founding dates. Comparison with archival sources like the Bay Area Human Service Directory (1977) suggests a high degree of coverage, though some undercounting may exist in activist-dense regions like San Francisco.\nUse case: Used in my empirical paper on the origins of Asian American and Latino panethnic organizations.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
