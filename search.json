The growing numbers of Asian Americans and Latinos are driving this change. However, the growth of these groups’ populations turns into politics only if there is unity among their members.\nContrary to conventional wisdom, the book argues that racial discrimination is not sufficient to explain when in-group solidarity emerges among minoritized populations. Despite the racial hierarchy in the United States, ethnic groups who have experienced discrimination have not always united politically.\nBefore the late 1960s, national origin groups from Asia and Latin America did not come together as Asian Americans and Latinos. Their mobilization strategy shifted during this historical juncture because of the policy changes. Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty programs expanded the American welfare state; however, these new safety net programs were implemented within the existing biracial framework. Street-level bureaucrats faced difficulty in classifying disadvantaged ethnic groups that did not fit into this prevalent image of the minority group. In response, non-target groups solved this collective problem by reinventing and organizing themselves in racial terms.\nThis book traces this origin story by examining the parallel emergence of Asian American and Latino community organizing, which preceded their electoral politics. It also assesses the argument’s scope conditions by comparing the variations in interethnic coalition formation in Chinatowns across the U.S. and Canadian border. Finally, it identifies the limitations of this contingent solidarity theory in the contemporary period of racial threats, awakenings, and underlying demographic changes.\nThe book connects scholarship on racial and ethnic politics, urban and local politics, policy implementation, community organizing, and political behavior from historical and comparative perspectives. The mix of original archival, organizational, survey, and experimental data deepens our understanding of how groups form and acquire political power in American politics and public policy.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

    "text": "How to write a statement of purpose for graduate school applications in political science\nI am a lazy person, and I hate repeating myself. So whenever I need to provide the same advice more than three times, I prefer writing these thoughts down and sharing them. For many years now, I’ve helped students to prepare their statement of purpose (SOP) for graduate school applications in political science. I have provided this service especially for students from marginalized populations and non-traditional backgrounds, to make the field more accessible to these students. The following tips are based on my experience and observations. Some usual cautions are warranted. These tips don’t represent everyone’s perspectives; you should take them as food for thought.\nFirst, put yourself in the shoes of admission committee members. What do they expect from the statement of purpose? They would like to understand why you are a solution to a particular problem in the field. To some extent, academic work is also entrepreneurial. We first need to create value and then monetize it (in our case, through publications). The value comes from identifying unsolved “interesting” and “important” problems. Show the admission committee how you discovered a problem in a particular literature based on your reading of the literature and previous (academic, professional, and lived) experiences. The problem/puzzle doesn’t need to be something ingenious. Creativity stems from remixing. For instance, you can say there’s a long-standing problem in literature A that can be solved by connecting literature A and literature B, collecting original data, or applying novel methods. So, identifying a problem and suggesting a solution often go together.\nSecond, outline and signpost your argument. Admission committee members have to read many applications in a limited time while dealing with other responsibilities. Therefore, helping them to do their job efficiently is also your job. There’s a hidden checklist that a committee member will likely apply to your SOP. Specifically, they would like to see some signs of careful engagement with the literature (a rough predictor of your performance in coursework plus field exams), skills in identifying a puzzle and designing research that tackles it (a rough predictor of the quality of your dissertation), and finally, your qualifications and plans to undertake the project using the resources provided by the program (your experience and fit). Given these expectations, the usual structure of an SOP is a hook (the first paragraph), the gap you identified in the literature (the second paragraph), your research design (the third paragraph), your qualifications to tackle it (the fourth and fifth paragraphs), and your fit to the program (the final paragraph). Provide relevant information and move it upfront so the committee members won’t miss it. In addition, think about what is the punchline of your SOP. If a committee member has finished reading your SOP, what should they take away from it? In their mind, what kind of candidate are you? Their impression should not be that you’re a smart and hardworking person (these are indistinguishable characteristics among candidates on the long list). Rather, you’re a solution to a specific, interesting, and important problem in the field, and the department has the right resources (faculty, training, etc.) to help you to resolve that problem.\nFinally, avoid (excessive) technical jargon. Write like a journalist rather than a lawyer. Not everyone reading your SOP is deeply familiar with your selected subfield and its literature. You must convince these people why you are a strong candidate they should admit. In fact, you need to make your SOP accessible, even better, relevant to them, so that you will have more people on your side, or at least no strong objections. Assume that people reading your SOP are upper-division undergraduates, intelligent but relatively new to your subject. You should signal that you’re informed; you know your subject matter. Using a certain amount of technical jargon is not a sin. But you don’t want to create the wrong impression, that you’re desperate to be taken seriously, by employing unnecessary technical jargon in your SOP. Your strength and fit should shine through your carefully crafted, framed, and organized argument.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Researching and Doing Policy Science as a Political Scientist\nI lead a dual life. On the one hand, I work full-time as a data scientist at Code for America, where the primary goal is to simplify, ease, and speed up safety net delivery. On the other hand, I conduct academic research affiliated with the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins on the side, where the goal is to advance academic research on civil society and democracy. It’s a tough balance. I have had to sacrifice many weekends and even breaks. However, I made this choice because my long-term goal is to become a researcher who produces high-quality research with real-world impacts.\nAn academic colleague recently asked me whether I identify myself as a data scientist or a political scientist, given my dual life. I said that I consider myself a policy scientist who believes in the value of effective government. As both a professional and a citizen, my goal is to contribute to making the government work for everyone, or at least to be a part of that effort.\nIn order to design, adopt, and implement good policies, it is sometimes necessary to understand politics, as it may be a key factor in explaining the origins, development, constraints, and possibilities of a given policy. The connection between politics and policy is why I pursued graduate studies, earned my Ph.D. in political science, and built my career in research.\nAlthough economics influences policy more than any other field, I was drawn to political science because it combines normative commitment and scientific rigor (Samii 2023; Popp Berman 2022). In economics, the primary consideration is cost-benefit analysis, which equates efficiency with values. Policy is seen as a tool, and if a method achieves a goal with less cost, it is considered more desirable. In contrast, from the perspective of political science, a policy is desirable if it upholds and promotes the values cherished by a democratic society. In political science, economic efficiency is just one important consideration among many. We also value normative principles, such as representation, accountability, and responsiveness. That is why political theory (or philosophy) remains a key subfield of political science, despite its marked differences from other fields where empirical methods play prominent roles.\nHowever, I find two aspects of political science research unsatisfactory. Since most academics don’t work within the government or with it, we must infer how elected representatives, bureaucrats, and voters believe, feel, think, and act based on accessible data. The issue is that accessible data are limited. Practitioners don’t have the time. Academics don’t have the data.\nThis is one of the main reasons why I became a practitioner in this field. My primary research area is poverty, and my goal is to gain insights into poverty management using internal data. Governments typically use case management systems to handle citizen cases and process applications for government programs. However, researchers often have a limited view of these systems, relying on government statistics or interviews. This results in a selected and restricted representation of a complex and extensive data landscape. Hence, my desire is to be in a position where I can access and observe the flow of this information within the government.\nAnother motivation was to better understand how to solve public problems. In order to improve a policy, I may need to modify or add certain features and test the changes. This requires partnering with the government to develop and test a research program (Duflo 2017). Although administrative data can be disorganized, it is often the only source of relevant data on social issues. This data can be used as a foundation for developing, testing, and improving policy ideas through an iterative process (Moynihan 2022).\nIt has been nine months since I transitioned from primarily being an academic researcher to becoming a data scientist. My main takeaway confirms my initial hypothesis: understanding how the government adopts and implements policies is valuable. Equally important is grasping how these cases are managed through the government’s information system. Furthermore, it is invaluable to be aware of the types of policy ideas that the government is willing to invest in and successfully implement in practice.\nThese are the types of skills and experiences that I could not have obtained solely from my graduate program and research career. I am grateful for the opportunities that my current job has provided me. I acquired this knowledge through close collaboration with government partners, and by developing and implementing a project with them through field experiments and surveys.\nNevertheless, I believe that research can play a crucial role in shaping sound policies and effective governance. Research and practice complement each other, with research informing practice and practice inspiring research (Stokes 1997). While academics may be too removed from the field, practitioners may be too immersed in it, leading to blind spots. Although research is not wholly objective, researchers can observe, theorize, and identify patterns. They can then analyze data to refine and validate ideas, eventually revealing what works and what does not. Research can shed light on what has been done and what has not, revealing possibilities and limitations while adding evidence to narratives.\nThe strength of political science in conducting policy research lies in its focus on politics. Good policies are not adopted or implemented solely based on their cost or value propositions. Rather, it is the influence of power that ultimately determines their fate. Decision-makers may not support sound policies not because they are inherently evil, but because they operate within institutional and organizational constraints that create certain incentives and disincentives.\nPoorly designed and implemented policies cannot deliver promised benefits. Government service is also a service. Based on my experience with the US government, I have observed that many policy failures result from well-intentioned procedures that ultimately end up hurting both staff and citizens. In essence, policies are likely to fail if street-level bureaucrats lack the knowledge possessed by citizens, and top-level bureaucrats lack the knowledge of street-level bureaucrats. Politics guides how policies are designed, and these default conditions have downstream effects.\nAlthough many political scientists left the study of policy adoption and implementation for public administration scholars, it was Aaron Wildavsky, one of the founding fathers of American politics field in political science, who co-authored a book titled Implementation in 1973.\nI became an applied data scientist in the public sector because I realized that there was a gap in my academic training and experience. Ironically, during this time, I rediscovered the value of academic research in political science for policy analysis. Political science research offers unique perspectives on the link between politics and policy, and how it affects the effective adoption and implementation of policies.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The Desire to Learn and the Desire to Serve\nLate last year, I left my tenure-track position to work as a professional data scientist. When someone asked me how it feels to move to the “other side” and what led me to make that decision, I realized that even though I’ve left academia in some sense, I haven’t left research. I still conduct research, design surveys and experiments, check data quality, analyze various kinds of data, and disseminate findings. My data science team also collaborates with academics from time to time. In addition, Code for America is a policy-focused organization. Basically, I am doing (social) data science for disadvantaged people in the US. I also maintain my academic affiliation and have a group of researchers with whom I have collaborated for many years. We continue to work on shared projects.\nTherefore, I see this chapter in my life not so much as a transition, but as an expansion or fusion of the two worlds: the academic and applied fields. I have inhabited both for a long time, and I have simply changed the composition of my portfolio. My research has become more applied-oriented, and I have replaced teaching with meetings with stakeholders and team members. If I used to play solo ping-pong, I now play full-team soccer. To use another analogy, I used to dream of running a Michelin-starred restaurant, but now I think of building a healthy fast food franchise (thanks to Nathan Matias for suggesting the latter metaphor). Outside academia, we need to do good (or good enough) work that is effective (correct) but also cost-effective (doable).\nAfter graduating from college, my first job was as a strategy manager at a startup. I reported to CxOs, analyzed market opportunities and risks, and did a variety of other tasks because the firm was still small. Although the fast-paced and high-pressure environment was challenging, I enjoyed organizing chaotic situations and finding direction in uncertain circumstances. However, I felt dissatisfied. Occasionally, I needed to analyze internal and external data to create a market strategy, but I wasn’t sure if my analytical approach was correct. I lacked the necessary skills and perspectives. I wanted to be a researcher who could distinguish fact from fiction. That’s why I decided to go to graduate school.\nTo make a long story short, I was incredibly lucky to attend Berkeley for my Ph.D. training in political science with an external fellowship. It was a fantastic experience. Berkeley was the place I had always dreamed of, and the Bay Area provided educational and career opportunities for my wife, who happened to be an engineer.\nAfter nearly completing my dissertation, I began working as a researcher at the SNF Agora Institute and P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Although my job title has changed slightly, my role has remained consistent. I collaborate with team members and organizations in the field to develop data and tools that promote effective civic engagement.\nMy decision to pursue this line of work stems from two desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. In graduate school, I learned invaluable skills—from social science theories to statistical, computational, and mixed methods. But I also learned from my advisors, peers, and people from all walks of life that I can use those skills to make an impact by being useful to others. These two desires define my work and identity.\nBefore joining the Code for America, I was a tenure-track professor at a policy school in South Korea for about a year. This decision was complicated by my mother’s debilitating health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strict quarantine policies in Korea made finding a job there the only viable option for me to stay with my mom in the long term. Last year I traveled back and forth between the US and South Korea many times. As my mom’s health improved, I began to consider moving back to the US, where my wife, child, close friends, and long-time colleagues are located. I was born in Korea but made in the US.\nReflecting on my career paths, I am grateful for their non-linear nature and for all the people I met along the way. I grew up in a semi-rural area in Korea where there was no library, and the only place to find books was a small bookstore. Despite reading almost all the available books, my hunger for knowledge only grew. My graduate school years were some of the best years of my life, as I was happy to learn from experts and develop my own intellectual identity. Nevertheless, I have never forgotten my roots. Both my wife and I come from working-class families, lost a parent early, and fought countless uphill battles. A stroke of incredible luck and the generosity of many people put me on the path I am on today. Therefore, I have been thinking about how to best use my time and energy to serve people, even while writing my dissertation. From this perspective, the transition I made last year was not a transition but rather the continuation of my life journey.\nI understand that in life, paths are often beyond our control. Even something as simple as sending my 4-year-old to daycare in the morning can be a struggle. However, I know that I am guided by two desires: the desire to learn and the desire to serve. These desires are my North Star, and I am committed to following them no matter what paths lie ahead of me in the future.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "What Running Taught Me: How to Fail and How to Grow Old\nIn early 2020, I took up running seriously. I used to be a martial arts enthusiast (I was a member of the Berkeley Taekwondo and Wushu club) and gym rat, but that changed after my first child came along. I simply had no time to do these things anymore. Instead, I hit the road.\nWhen the pandemic emerged, I traded my long commuting time for running. I typically run 4 to 5 days a week, each time going about 10-15 kilometers (around 6 to 9 miles). I am not fast and my form is ugly. Yet, I run because I don’t care. Running calms my troubled mind. While physical by nature, running is also deeply mental, meditative, and contemplative. Using running as a form of meditation, I have learned how to fail and how to grow old.\nIn my experience, life as a professional researcher is about dealing with failure. Beginning from graduate school, I don’t know how often my papers, fellowship and grant proposals, and job applications were rejected. However, I learned that to be recognized; one must be bold, ambitious, and unafraid to take risks. Inevitably, this will include moments of failure. Yet, this is the only true way to discover and unleash your full potential. Nevertheless, the brutal process is anything but fun.\nI decided to start running because I read about its positive effects on mental health. I hoped that running could reduce my work- and parenting-related stress. However, when I started training for running, I viewed it as if it was my work. I set goals, such as speed and distance, and committed myself to reaching them.\nThrough trial and error, I learned that what matters is finding pleasure. Now when I run, I don’t focus on how fast I am or how many miles I can do. Rather, I stay in the moment, focusing on proper breathing, foot landing, and, most importantly, going with the flow. As the sound of my footsteps becomes akin to music, my mind drifts away, along with my worries and anxieties.\nWhat I’ve learned from running has served me in life. I am applying the wisdom gleaned from running to my work. Yes, I still must set defined goals to measure my progress but when I’m working, I don’t think about them. I focus on what and how I learn; finding the flow so I can continue to learn tomorrow, the day after that, and so on (Haruki Murakami the famed Japanese novelist offered the same reflection in his running memoir What I Talk About Running When I Talk About Running). In the process, I know setbacks and failures will occur. I will be slower and run fewer miles than I want to. This is fine as long as I hit the road the next day and find joy in it. I run to be happy. I also work to be happy.\nThe other important lesson I’ve learned is how to grow old. Aside from not having the time in my schedule, I became less interested in martial arts due to physical challenges. As I aged, I got injured more easily when sparring and I needed more time to recover. Though difficult, I have to be honest with myself: I’m getting old. Instead of resisting the inevitable, I am trying to adapt. Running more seriously and consciously is the start. As long as my legs can carry my body, I intend to run, work, and cherish every moment in my life. I ran my first half marathon in 2021 and signed up for a full marathon race in 2024. Since 2020, I’ve run almost everywhere I lived, visited, and traveled: the San Francisco Bay Area, the Greater Los Angles Area, Lake Tahoe, Honolulu, Chicago, Montreal, and several cities in South Korea.\n\nThe 2021 San Francisco Marathon\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Four Tips on How to Approach Job Interviews\nI’ve had a non-linear career path, so I’ve done job interviews for private firms, nonprofits, and academic positions. I’ve also been on the other side, getting involved in hiring at various places.\nThe following tips are obvious to mid-career professionals, but they seem less well-known to those who have just entered the job market. These tips help you avoid common mistakes during interviews in the academic and non-academic job markets.\nFirst, hiring is a solution to an organization’s problem. So during the interview process, the focus should be on why and how you are an excellent solution to a specific problem. The focus should not be on how smart you are. How do we know what the organization’s problem is? Getting that answer is relatively easy if you know someone inside the organization directly involved in hiring. Even if you don’t, there are still other ways. On the academic job market, you can ask such questions to the search committee chair. On the alt-academic job market, you can raise such questions to the recruiter/hiring manager. Responding to this kind of question is their job. Knowing what the other needs and wants has to be the first step in preparing for a job interview.\nSecond, be yourself. You can’t and don’t need to be someone else. If the organization you applied for doesn’t like who you are or what you want to be, think about whether there’s room for compromise or it’s just a bad fit. An interview is a process in which the two parties learn about each other. In the end, if you realize that your and the organization’s values and needs are not strongly aligned, not getting the job offer is a blessing in disguise. There will be another job, another opportunity.\nThird, listen actively. An interview is a two-way street. On the academic job market, a candidate performs a job talk followed by a Q&A. On the alt-academic job market, a candidate conducts multiple rounds of interviews with multiple stakeholders. The settings vary, but the principle is quite similar. When you talk, consider that your words are an invitation to a conversation. After your share is done, let the others talk, listen to them carefully, learn what they are curious about, and engage actively.\nParaphrasing what Maya Angelou said, most people don’t recall exactly what you said (or even who you are), but they will never forget how you made them feel. Make the audience feel respected, understood, and connected. For instance, consider writing down what the other people asked, repeating their questions briefly to make sure you understood them correctly, and answering all of them thoughtfully.\nLastly, know thy audience. An interviewer needs to interview multiple candidates. It is a tough and often boring job. You can be kind to them by making the interview experience 10% more pleasant. On the academic or alt-academic job market, it’s easy to know who your interviewer will be. Study their backgrounds, interests, and recent projects (Googling is your friend). In an academic job talk, consider relating what you say to the interests of your target audience. Doing so signals that you know what they care about, and that you care about it too. In the alt-academic job market, a candidate does multiple one-on-one interviews. In most of these settings, one-third or half of the interview time is devoted to Q&A. When an interviewer asks what you would like to know, don’t ask what you really would like to know. You can ask these questions once you get an offer. Instead, ask questions that the other side would consider interesting and important. Once again, doing so signals that you understand what your interviewer does and are willing to listen and understand it better.\nEvery job interview is stressful, but it is a learning process about yourself and many great organizations. You can help yourself by helping the other side. I hope you’ve learned something useful from the above tips, and please don’t hesitate to share your tips with me and others.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Hard But Good\nI’m getting old. It’s not great in many areas, but there’s one silver lining. I began to get to know more about myself and to understand and embrace my strengths and weaknesses.\nOne example is that I understand that I thrive on challenging projects. If a project is too easy, I struggle to stay focused because it lacks interest. I find satisfaction in solving analytical puzzles that demand my full attention, engaging my mind, body, and soul. I am drawn to projects that have not been attempted before or are considered difficult by many. I enjoy breaking down a large project into smaller pieces, transforming a vague question into a tractable problem, and methodically checking off items on a lengthy to-do list.\nI hold a PhD from a top department in my field and currently work as a professional researcher and data scientist. However, my academic performance was poor until high school, and none of my teachers believed that I would attend a reputable college. It’s not that I hated learning; I hated school. I thoroughly enjoyed learning, reading, and solving problems. The pressure to study solely for exams and grades did not motivate me. High school subjects became more enjoyable because they were more challenging. College courses were even more fun because they presented an even greater level of difficulty. My years in graduate school were the best of my life. They provided me with valuable skills, perspectives, and unforgettable experiences. It was during this time that I became dedicated to my physical training as well. I joined martial arts clubs and learned how to properly condition my mind and body. Additionally, I completed my first half marathon during this period. Running has become an integral part of my daily routine.\nSimply doing challenging work alone, however, is not enough for me. I find greater motivation when I understand the significance of my work. I enjoy learning and occasionally conduct research out of pure curiosity. However, there are moments when I desire to engage in research that directly benefits people, especially those who are disadvantaged.\nI come from a working-class family. My dad worked as a factory worker for 32 years, and unfortunately, my mom was left alone after my dad passed away from cancer. Financial stress was a constant part of my life. I was fortunate to receive both departmental and external fellowships during my graduate studies. However, due to my family background and the fact that my wife was unable to work during my early years of graduate studies due to visa restrictions, I had to take on side gigs to make ends meet in the Bay Area, one of the most expensive places in the United States.\nLike many immigrants in this country, I hustled to obtain a better education, develop my skills, and secure a place for myself and my family. I will never forget that arduous journey. The past is also a part of who I am.\nI want to do hard but good work for people struggling to do better for themselves and their loved ones. I want to help us find terms under which we can all work and live together. That’s why I have become a social scientist and conduct both basic and applied research.\nDoing hard but meaningful work encapsulates my motivation strategies. It reflects what fires me up when I wake up in the morning and the relentless passion that continues to guide my life and career decisions.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I wrote the following essay a couple of years ago. I am sharing this again after I learned that I am the co-winner of the APSA’s Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics this year. My dissertation is titled “The Politics of Solidarity in Multiracial America.”\n\nSpeaking of Speaking English\nI switched my main subfield from comparative to American politics by the end of my second year. The motivation was simple: so many Americans are experts on non-US politics, but I wanted to show that the field should be a two-way street. International graduate students also have something to say about American politics, and that contribution could be invaluable. After I made that transition, I inadvertently became one of the very few minority students—and likely the only non-native speaker—whenever I attended seminars, workshops, and conferences on American politics.\nArticulating complex ideas in a second or even third language is traumatizing. This does not stem from the difficulty involved in communicating ideas because that is a technical issue. The stigma comes more from knowing that someone in the audience will make a snap judgment on my intellect due to my accent. I didn’t need my training in social psychology to anticipate that this would happen. Over the past couple years, I’ve received such judgments from a number of highly intellectual and well-respected people in and outside Berkeley. When it happened for the first time, it was like being punched in the stomach. It was difficult to swallow my feelings and erase the experience from my memory. Those moments still haunt me like a ghost and make me simultaneously sad, angry, and frustrated. I don’t think these people were racist, they were just insensitive and unaware that their careless words can hurt. Each word may weigh little, but when combined, they become a thousand papercuts.\nI presume someone who moved to the States when they were a child might have gone through a similar experience—classmates made fun of you because you sounded different. My colleagues were more respectful but perhaps more judgmental. More importantly, what they thought, said, and wrote about me and my work were consequential to my career.\nFor this and other reasons, in recent years, I’ve moved from political science to computational social science, which sits at the intersection between social science and data science. I still work on some traditional political science problems, but it’s clear that I no longer want to feel isolated and marginalized because I don’t look or sound like most of the others. Computational social science also has serious inclusion and diversity issues, yet my experience tells me that there I am no longer the only non-native English speaker sitting in a vast seminar room constantly worrying about what people think of my accent. This personal experience also motivated me to spend substantial time and energy teaching statistics and data science tools to students from non-traditional backgrounds.\nIf you’ve read this far and if you are one of my political scientist colleagues, I sincerely express my gratitude and have one simple request: if you think that the US-centric world view is problematic and the field needs to diversify, never make a condescending comment like “the author is not a native speaker.” Such comments serve no constructive goals. What they do is amplifying bias and signify your privilege when the field already has so many problems. Let’s make the world a better place by being nice. Each one of you has an underappreciated superpower: you can make an enormous difference just by being kind to someone who is struggling to find their place in a strange new world.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
