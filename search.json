These exclusionary practices were not merely symbolic; they had material consequences, shaping access to public resources and political recognition. While classification decisions were made at the federal level, they were felt most acutely at the local level‚Äîthrough everyday interactions with street-level bureaucrats who implemented social policy. These encounters often determined whether individuals and communities were seen, counted, and served.\nIn response, ethnic elites engaged in political innovation: they coined new panethnic labels, formed cross-ethnic coalitions, and founded civic organizations to make their communities legible to the state. Though these efforts were locally grounded, they scaled upward. Over time, the categories and claims forged in neighborhoods and community institutions began to influence how government agencies enumerated populations and administered benefits. These bottom-up innovations ultimately helped reshape the very bureaucratic systems that had once excluded them.\nThe book draws on original archival research, a dataset of over 800 ethnic organizations, and computational analysis of 78,000 articles from ethnic newspapers. Through comparative analysis across cities, racial groups, and national contexts‚Äîincluding U.S.‚ÄìCanada, Asian‚ÄìLatino, and Asian‚ÄìBlack comparisons‚Äîit demonstrates that panethnic identities did not emerge from shared culture or inherent solidarity. Instead, they were the product of strategic adaptation to the bureaucratic logics and incentive structures of the modern state.\nBy foregrounding the politics of classification and the local implementation of federal policy, Unseen and Uncounted reframes panethnic formation as a historically contingent, politically driven process. The book contributes to ongoing debates in political science, sociology, public administration, and history, offering new insight into how racial categories are constructed, contested, and institutionalized in American political development.\nUniversity presses specializing in American politics and public policy are warmly encouraged to reach out to discuss this book project further. I look forward to engaging with publishers committed to rigorous, interdisciplinary scholarship in these areas.\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Advocacy, Service, and Hybrid Organizations.

Written by social data scientist and public interest technologist Jae Yeon Kim, the book draws on real-world policy examples from the U.S. and South Korea to show how government data systems shape who gets access to benefits, who gets heard, and who gets left behind. Across ten clear and accessible chapters, Kim offers a roadmap for building a more equitable, citizen-centered digital state. From improving public service interfaces to training the next generation of civic data scientists, this book reimagines public data not just as infrastructure, but as a foundation for stronger democracy and better government.\nImpact & Recognition\n\nSelected as one of 70 finalists by the Korean Government in the popular social science category for 2024; the government purchased approximately 500 copies and distributed them to public libraries nationwide\nRecommended by the National Assembly Library, Samsung Global Research‚Äôs executive education program (SERICEO), and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)\nFeatured in major Korean newspapers across the ideological spectrum:\nThe Chosun Ilbo,\nMaeil Business Newspaper,\nThe Korea Economic Daily,\nKyunghyang Shinmun,\nHankyoreh\nRegular op-eds based on the book published in:\nChosun Ilbo‚Äôs Civic Section (a major conservative newspaper) and\nWeekly Kyunghang (a major liberal magazine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúHow to Use University: A Practical Guide for College Students (in Korean)‚Äù (Sejong Books, 2014)\n\nWhy do so many students enter college full of ambition‚Äîonly to graduate with more confusion than clarity?\nHow to Use University is a practical, student-centered guide to navigating college with purpose, curiosity, and intention. Organized around four core themes‚Äîexploring college, learning, career, and life‚Äîit helps students shift from passive schooling to intentional, opportunity-driven learning. The book encourages students to treat the university as a launchpad‚Äînot a system to passively endure‚Äîfor discovering interests, initiating projects, and building momentum. It emphasizes a key idea: unlocking even one small opportunity‚Äîespecially a self-initiated project‚Äîcan set off a cycle of opportunities that grows over time. With its structured framework, practical strategies, and ethos of civic-minded entrepreneurship, this book has become a trusted companion for Korean college students seeking clarity, growth, and public impact.\nImpact & Recognition\n\nThe first edition sold over 10,000 copies and has been widely recommended by educators, university counselors, and mentoring programs across South Korea\nFeatured in major Korean media outlets including Maeil Business Newspaper and Chosun Biz\nFrequently used in student development seminars and campus book clubs\nA fully revised second edition is coming soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "I Didn‚Äôt Think I‚Äôd Return to Academia ‚Äî Until I Saw What Was Missing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A little over a year into my data science role outside academia, in spring 2024, I spoke on the ‚ÄúData Science Across Industries‚Äù panel at the PhD Pathways event at Stanford. Ironically, the panel was designed to help PhD students and postdocs explore careers outside the academy‚Äîbut for me, it triggered a return. I had spent the past year applying my research skills to public problems‚Äîdesigning field experiments with government partners, analyzing administrative data, and learning from people who navigated public systems every day. I believed in the work. I still do. But listening to early-career scholars talk about their hopes for impact, I felt something shift.\nI wasn‚Äôt done with academia. I just hadn‚Äôt found the version of it I believed in yet.\nIn 2022, I had left a tenure-track job to join Code for America, a civic tech nonprofit focused on improving access to public services through technology, design, and data. It was a leap. I didn‚Äôt fully know what to expect. But I wanted to learn how research could serve real people. Over the next two years, I helped build experiments with U.S. state and local governments, sat in on user interviews, and saw how broken public systems were‚Äîand how much potential there was for research to do more than describe and analyze problems. It could help fix them.\nAt the time, I thought I was stepping away from academia for good. In reality, I was becoming a different kind of researcher‚Äîone more attuned to practical constraints, lived experience, and the institutional frictions that shape how policy is delivered.\nI learned new technical skills, yes, but I also learned how to work in multidisciplinary teams, how to frame questions that mattered beyond the academy, and how to generate evidence that was timely, usable, and grounded in context. The experience rewired how I think about rigor, relevance, and responsibility.\nStill, the decision to return wasn‚Äôt easy. That moment at Stanford made me confront it. Did I still belong in academia? Could I reconcile the intellectual freedom I valued with the applied, collaborative work I had grown to love?\nRather than returning to where I left off, I chose to carry what I‚Äôd learned with me. I began to imagine a different kind of academic life‚Äîone that connects rigorous scholarship with real-world impact, and that bridges research and practice to improve public institutions and better serve communities. In 2026, I‚Äôll begin a position as an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina‚ÄìChapel Hill. The opportunity to return wasn‚Äôt a reset‚Äîit was a reinvention.\nToo often, we present academic and non-academic paths as a binary. But that framing misses what‚Äôs happening at the intersections. Some of the most exciting work today‚Äîboth intellectually and practically‚Äîis happening across sectors: in government, nonprofits, and industry, where researchers are advancing theory and solving problems at the same time.\nRather than asking where research happens, I‚Äôve learned to ask what kind of research I want to do‚Äîand why it matters.\nPhD programs rarely teach us that stepping outside academia can strengthen our scholarship. In graduate school, I was trained to run a Michelin-starred kitchen: refined, precise, and optimized for a narrow audience. Outside academia, I learned to run a healthy fast-food franchise: fast, responsive, and designed to meet people where they are. Both forms of work require creativity and care‚Äîbut the tools, audiences, and stakes are different.\nFor early-career researchers, the message too often is: once you leave, you can‚Äôt come back. But that‚Äôs not true. Some of the most meaningful research I‚Äôve done happened outside the university‚Äîwithout the academic title, but with a clear research purpose. Leaving academia doesn‚Äôt mean leaving research. It can deepen it, offering a different vantage point shaped by institutional constraints, real-world complexity, and the lived experiences of the people your work is meant to serve. If anything, stepping outside can sharpen your sense of what questions matter, who they matter to, and how evidence can contribute to lasting change.\nWhat I‚Äôve Learned\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to choose once and for all. Careers are nonlinear. The skills you build across domains can make you a better scholar, collaborator, and teacher.\nSeek alignment, not just prestige, and define success on your own terms. The right environment‚Äîwhether inside or outside academia‚Äîshould reflect your values and help you reconnect with why you became a researcher in the first place. Success might be a paper, a public dashboard, a field experiment, or a policy shift. If it helps people and moves your mission forward, it counts.\nResearch is portable. Stepping outside of academia doesn‚Äôt mean abandoning your identity as a researcher. It can sharpen your questions, broaden your perspective, and deepen your sense of what knowledge is for.\n\nHere‚Äôs the bigger lesson. In a time of rising skepticism toward research and higher education, the best way to defend scholarship is to make it matter‚Äîto connect it to the people and problems it‚Äôs meant to serve. We do that not by standing apart, but by stepping in.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A Dual Life\nIn 2023, I was living a kind of dual life. I was a data scientist at Code for America, working on digital access to safety net programs. At the same time, I held an academic affiliation with the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins, continuing to write and collaborate on political science research. My day job was deeply practical and policy-oriented. My evenings and weekends were devoted to research, writing, and academic seminars.\nThis duality wasn‚Äôt just about time management‚Äîit was about navigating two institutional worlds. But it also reflected the deeper structure of my work. Even at Code for America, my projects had an academic-facing element. I worked on field experiments and policy evaluations in partnership with the Better Government Lab at Georgetown University‚Äôs McCourt School of Public Policy and the University of Michigan‚Äôs Ford School of Public Policy. These collaborations helped bridge the line between implementation and research, between public service and public knowledge.\nBalancing both roles was demanding. But I chose this path because I believe scholarship shouldn‚Äôt just describe the world‚Äîit should help improve it. I want my research to be rigorous, but also relevant. And that belief has shaped how I think of myself today.\nA Question of Identity\nAt the 2023 American Political Science Association (APSA) annual meeting, a colleague asked me a simple question: ‚ÄúSo, are you a political scientist or a data scientist now?‚Äù\nI paused. Then I said, ‚ÄúI think of myself as a policy scientist.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs not a title that appears on business cards. But it captures what I do‚Äîand what I care about. I study how public policies are created, delivered, and experienced. And I work to make government more responsive, equitable, and effective‚Äînot in theory, but in practice.\nThat goal led me into political science. And it‚Äôs the same goal that, for a time, led me outside of it.\nWhy Political Science Still Matters\nPolicy doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. Even the best-designed solutions can fail if they don‚Äôt survive the political process. That‚Äôs why I chose political science over economics. Economics offers sharp tools, but often narrows its focus to efficiency. Political science brings power, institutions, and values into the frame. It reminds us that a ‚Äúgood‚Äù policy must also be a just one‚Äîand a legitimate one.\nBut I‚Äôve come to believe that political science, as practiced, has two persistent gaps.\nThe first is access. Most academics don‚Äôt have access to the internal data or conversations that drive government decision-making. As a result, we often rely on incomplete or surface-level information.\nThe second is experience. Many political scientists haven‚Äôt worked inside government. So we miss the incentives, constraints, and organizational realities that shape what actually gets implemented.\nThese aren‚Äôt fatal flaws. But they do limit how much impact research can have. I stepped into the practitioner world to better understand those gaps‚Äîand to begin bridging them.\nWhat I Learned in the Field\nWithin nine months at Code for America, I had learned more about public administration than in any single seminar I had taken in graduate school. I learned how eligibility flows are built into backend systems, how frontline staff manage tradeoffs under pressure, and what kinds of interventions agencies are actually willing to pilot.\nNone of this came from reading theory. It came from co-designing projects with county and state governments, launching field experiments, and troubleshooting implementation problems in real time.\nAnd yet, the more I engaged with practice, the more I rediscovered the value of research.\nPractitioners are deep in the weeds. Researchers step back. Both perspectives are incomplete on their own‚Äîbut powerful when combined. Research makes sense of patterns, names concepts, and connects cases. Practice reminds us what‚Äôs feasible, what‚Äôs urgent, and what actually matters to those doing the work.\nWhy Politics Still Shapes Policy\nGood ideas fail all the time. Not because they‚Äôre unworkable, but because they‚Äôre politically inconvenient. Policy decisions are filtered through institutions, norms, and power dynamics. They reflect not just evidence, but relationships.\nThat‚Äôs where political science has something essential to offer. It reminds us that implementation is not just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs political. It‚Äôs about who has discretion, what rules are enforced, and whose interests are prioritized.\nSometimes policies fail because senior officials don‚Äôt understand frontline needs. Other times, staff lack access to insights held by clients. These breakdowns aren‚Äôt just process failures‚Äîthey‚Äôre symptoms of deeper misalignments in authority, communication, and design.\nPolitical science once played a central role in studying these dynamics. Implementation (1973) by Pressman and Wildavsky helped define a generation of policy research. But over time, much of that work shifted to public administration. I believe political science still has a vital role to play‚Äîespecially if it returns to the front lines of how policy is experienced.\nWhat I Carry Forward\nWorking outside academia didn‚Äôt make me less of a political scientist. If anything, it helped me become a more grounded one. It taught me where the real points of friction are‚Äîbetween ideals and incentives, between design and delivery.\nI still care about theory. I still care about publication. But I also care about building the kind of research that public institutions can actually use. Research that informs, illuminates, and sometimes even shapes the choices governments make.\nI didn‚Äôt stop being a political scientist when I left campus. If anything, I became a better one. And I believe that those of us who move between research and practice have a role to play‚Äînot just in translating ideas, but in shaping a future where scholarship and service are no longer separate paths.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "I was sometimes asked, as a political scientist, what kind of dinner conversations I had with my parents and whether we ever talked about politics. The truth is, we didn‚Äôt talk about politics at dinner‚Äîor at all‚Äîand, in fact, we rarely shared a family meal together.\nI grew up in a household shaped by the rhythms of collective labor and strict hierarchy‚Äîvalues my father carried from his childhood on a rice farm, where everyone worked together from dawn to dusk and orders went unquestioned. When he later worked as an electrician in a paper mill, the setting shifted from rural fields to noisy factory floors, but the demands‚Äîearly mornings, long hours, late nights‚Äîremained just as relentless. My parents tried to carve out fun with occasional day trips on a tight budget, but real holidays and vacations were still few and far between. Even now, I struggle to plan or enjoy a break because I never had a clear model for what that looks like.\nGiven my own difficult childhood, I hesitated to become a father. But fatherhood has been a second chance to live the childhood I missed‚Äîand it all happens through my daughter‚Äôs eyes. She truly is my sunshine: outgoing and radiant, already a budding artist who draws, sings, and dances; a devoted fan of unicorns, squirrels, and cats; and the proud author of her first comic book. I love her not just because she‚Äôs my daughter, but because her boundless energy and curiosity remind me every day what wonder feels like.\nWhen my daughter arrived, I resolved to create something very different. I wanted her to know that trouble-making‚Äîwhen done with respect and purpose‚Äîis essential to change. I explain which rules deserve our respect and which deserve our questions. I encourage her to claim her rights and speak up whenever she sees unfairness, trusting that her perspective matters.\nMy emphasis on ‚Äúgood trouble‚Äù was inspired by the late Congressman John Lewis, who urged us to ‚Äúget in good trouble, necessary trouble.‚Äù Lewis‚Äîson of an Alabama sharecropper‚Äîlearned from Rosa Parks and the civil-rights movement that moral courage sometimes means breaking unjust rules. I want my daughter to understand that she has choices, to make them boldly, and to own the consequences.\nTo bring these lessons alive, I draw on my Harvard Kennedy School colleague Marshall Ganz‚Äôs Public Narrative framework‚Äîan approach that guides my research, my teaching, and even my parenting. At home‚Äîwhether we‚Äôre at the dinner table, walking through the neighborhood, or riding bikes together‚ÄîI‚Äôll ask questions like:\n\nStory of Self: ‚ÄúWhat did you do at school today, and which moment made you feel proud or frustrated?‚Äù\nStory of Us: ‚ÄúDid you notice friends having similar moments‚Äîtimes they felt proud or frustrated‚Äîand what happened for them?‚Äù\nStory of Now: ‚ÄúDid you see anything that didn‚Äôt seem fair, or any act of kindness, and what could you and your friends do about it?‚Äù\n\nShe may not yet know words like ‚Äúagency,‚Äù ‚Äúcollective action,‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic narrative,‚Äù but I trust these conversations will become part of her inner compass. I have no idea what the future holds, but I want her to tell her own story, listen to others with empathy, and build a community grounded in shared purpose.\nIn our home, good trouble-making is a commitment to shared values and a shared future. It isn‚Äôt about chaos or disrespect‚Äîit‚Äôs about curiosity, courage, and community: asking hard questions, claiming the space to be heard, and working alongside others who share your concerns. That‚Äôs the kind of good trouble I hope she‚Äîand we‚Äîcontinue to make.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Four Tips on How to Approach Job Interviews",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI‚Äôve had a non-linear career path. Along the way, I‚Äôve interviewed for roles in the private sector, nonprofits, and academia‚Äîand I‚Äôve also served on hiring committees across those sectors. With time, I‚Äôve come to see interviews less as high-stakes performances and more as conversations‚Äîopportunities to figure out whether you and the organization are truly a good fit.\nThese four tips are things I wish I had known earlier in my career. They might seem obvious to seasoned professionals, but they‚Äôre not always intuitive to people just entering the job market‚Äîwhether in academia or beyond.\n1. Hiring is about solving a problem‚Äîfocus on how you‚Äôre the solution\nEvery hiring process begins with a problem. A team needs capacity, a department needs expertise, a program needs leadership. Your goal in an interview is not to prove how smart or qualified you are‚Äîit‚Äôs to show how you can help solve that specific problem.\nSometimes, the problem is clearly stated in the job ad. But often, it takes some digging. If you have contacts inside the organization, ask them what the real needs are. If you don‚Äôt, you can still ask the search committee chair (in academia) or the recruiter or hiring manager (in other settings). That‚Äôs their job, and most will be willing to offer insight.\nGood preparation begins with understanding what the other side wants and needs. From there, you can tailor your responses to show that you‚Äôre not just qualified‚Äîyou‚Äôre aligned.\n2. Be yourself‚Äîand remember, you‚Äôre interviewing them too\nIt‚Äôs easy to feel like you have to mold yourself into the ‚Äúideal‚Äù candidate. But that instinct can backfire. The best interviews happen when you speak with clarity about who you are and what kind of work you want to do. If the organization isn‚Äôt drawn to that, it might not be the right place for you.\nAn interview is a mutual learning process. If, by the end, you realize the values or goals don‚Äôt align, then not getting the offer is actually a useful outcome. Another opportunity will come‚Äîone where you won‚Äôt feel the need to hide or shrink who you are.\n3. Listen as much as you speak\nInterviews vary by sector. In academia, you give a job talk and answer questions. In other sectors, you often go through rounds of one-on-one or panel interviews. But across contexts, one principle holds: conversation beats monologue.\nTreat your responses as invitations, not conclusions. When others speak, really listen. Take notes. Echo back what they‚Äôve said to show understanding. It might seem small, but these habits leave a lasting impression.\nPeople might not remember the exact words you said. But they will remember how you made them feel. Make them feel heard. Make them feel respected.\n4. Know your audience‚Äîand make their job easier\nInterviewers often have to meet multiple candidates. It‚Äôs time-consuming, and sometimes exhausting. One of the kindest things you can do is make their experience even 10% more pleasant.\nBefore the interview, learn who your interviewers are. Read their bios. Look up their work. In academic settings, you can reference their interests directly in your talk. In other contexts, you can tailor your questions based on what they do.\nWhen they ask if you have any questions, don‚Äôt use that time to negotiate or express your doubts. Save that for after the offer. Instead, ask questions that reflect curiosity about their work or their vision for the team. It signals that you‚Äôve done your homework‚Äîand that you‚Äôre thinking like a future colleague.\nConclusion\nEvery interview is a little stressful. That‚Äôs normal. But it‚Äôs also a chance to learn‚Äînot just about potential roles, but about yourself. The better you understand your own values, the more clearly you‚Äôll see whether a place feels like home.\nAnd sometimes, the best way to help yourself in an interview is to focus on helping the other side. Make it easy for them to see how you fit. Make it easy for them to remember you‚Äîbecause of how you made them feel.\nIf you‚Äôve found something useful here, I hope you‚Äôll pass it along. And if you have tips of your own, I‚Äôd love to hear them.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "What I Wish I Knew Before the Academic Job Market",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I first entered the academic job market in the U.S., in my fifth year of graduate school, I revised my materials, practiced my job talk, followed every checklist‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt sure what would actually matter. Like many others, I assumed it was about proving I was good enough.\nOver time‚Äîand with experience‚ÄîI came to see things differently. The job market isn‚Äôt just about being the strongest candidate. It‚Äôs about fit, timing, and clarity. These are a few lessons I wish someone had shared with me earlier.\nUnderstanding the Process Helps‚ÄîBut It Won‚Äôt Explain Everything\nThe academic job market can feel like a black box. In reality, it‚Äôs a long, uneven process. The Berkeley Career Center explains it well: departments typically request permission to hire in the spring, post job ads in the fall, interview in the winter, and extend offers in the spring‚Äîthough it rarely runs smoothly.\nEven the job ad can be misleading. It‚Äôs often a compromise between faculty interests and administrative approval. It may not reflect a unified vision or clear priorities. That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt dismiss an opportunity just because you don‚Äôt fit the ad perfectly. Your job is to make the case for how your work fits‚Äîon your terms.\n1. Fit matters, and it‚Äôs not something you can force.\nThe job market is a two-way street. Departments are looking for candidates who fit their needs, but you‚Äôre also looking for a place that fits you. It‚Äôs not just about the job description; it‚Äôs about the culture, the people, and the values of the department.\nNo one has a complete picture of what a department is like from the outside. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to ask questions‚Äîto a lot of people. If you attend a conference or visit a campus, seek out informal conversations. Reach out to people whose work you admire. Read their papers, ask thoughtful questions, and follow up. These small gestures can build trust‚Äîand sometimes open doors.\nMany candidates think the market is a straight competition. But departments aren‚Äôt always hiring ‚Äúthe best‚Äù candidate in the abstract. They‚Äôre hiring the person whose work, teaching, and trajectory align with their evolving needs.\nThat‚Äôs why clarity is so important. Your materials should make it easy to see how your work connects to what the department values.\nNot all departments‚Äîor professional schools‚Äîwant the same things. Some prioritize theory and publications; others value applied relevance or interdisciplinary work. Even within fields, expectations vary.\nYou don‚Äôt need to change who you are. Focus instead on finding an environment where you can grow into the scholar and colleague you want to be. The job market is partly about being chosen‚Äîbut also about choosing well.\n2. Define your direction‚Äîclearly, but with room to grow.\nOne thing that helps: write down your research in a single sentence. Not just the topic, but the question‚Äîand what you‚Äôre trying to understand about the world. Clear, simple language is better than buzzwords.\nThat sentence will anchor your job talk, research statement, and cover letter. It helps committees remember you.\nBut the job market isn‚Äôt just about your present. Committees want to know where you‚Äôre headed. What questions will guide your next projects? How will your research evolve over the next few years? They‚Äôre assessing your pipeline‚Äîyour ability to sustain a coherent and growing scholarly agenda.\nThink, too, about alignment. Where does your research direction intersect with the department‚Äôs and school‚Äôs broader vision? Where could you find not just a place to land, but momentum to grow? You don‚Äôt need all the answers. But showing that you‚Äôve thought ahead goes a long way.\n3. Conversations, Not Auditions\nJob talks, interviews, hallway chats‚Äîthey‚Äôre all part of an extended conversation. It‚Äôs not about delivering perfect answers. It‚Äôs about showing how you think, listen, and engage in real time. Think of it as jazz: you don‚Äôt control the setting, but you can improvise with care and attentiveness.\nThe job talk, in particular, is high-stakes. It probably won‚Äôt win you the job outright‚Äîbut it can certainly lose it. Committees are looking for clarity, coherence, and the ability to communicate beyond your subfield. A poor talk can be disqualifying, even if everything else looks strong. The Q&A often matters as much as the presentation itself. It reveals how you handle feedback and interact with others‚Äîa glimpse of you as a colleague.\nAnd when someone asks if you have questions, take it seriously. Thoughtful questions show that you‚Äôve imagined yourself in the role. What kind of mentorship do junior faculty receive? What directions is the department hoping to grow in? What do they hope this new hire will help build? These conversations reveal as much about them as they do about you‚Äîbecause the people you‚Äôre talking to are not just evaluating you; they are your potential future colleagues. Treat these moments as the beginning of a professional relationship. Be curious, engaged, and respectful.\nIf You‚Äôre Going on the Market\nEveryone‚Äôs job market story is different. Some people get lucky quickly. Others take longer. And sometimes even the best-prepared candidates don‚Äôt get the outcome they hoped for. Part of this depends on the structure of your dissertation‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs designed as a three-paper project or a book‚Äîand whether you‚Äôre fortunate enough to publish a chapter in a top journal before going on the market. Some of these factors are within your control. Others aren‚Äôt. Especially if you‚Äôre going on the market as an ABD, your advisor‚Äôs letters matter a great deal. Strong, specific letters from your committee can shape how committees see your potential‚Äîand help compensate for what‚Äôs still in progress.\nWhat helped me was shifting the question‚Äîfrom ‚ÄúAm I good enough?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhere do I want to grow next, and with whom?‚Äù What matters most isn‚Äôt perfection. It‚Äôs having a clear vision, a trajectory you believe in, and enough momentum to keep moving forward.\nYou won‚Äôt be the right fit everywhere. That‚Äôs okay. You only need one place where your work resonates‚Äîand where you can continue to grow.\nI‚Äôm still learning. But if you‚Äôre preparing now, I hope this gives you a bit more confidence‚Äîand a little peace of mind. Build your community of mentors and supporters, and lean on them. The process is easier‚Äîand more rewarding‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre not doing it alone.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Talent is everywhere‚Äîbut the systems to support it aren‚Äôt.\nTo ensure technology serves democracy, we must invest in civic tech ecosystems around the world.\nToday, I had a conversation with a Korean machine learning engineer working in the UK. She had a clear sense of the kind of public impact she wanted to create‚Äîusing her skills for projects with social value and long-term civic purpose. Her story reminded me of my mentor at Code for America, who spent over a decade at Google and other tech companies before shifting into public interest work. They showed me that world-class technical skill can be redirected toward systems that serve the public. People like this are everywhere. What‚Äôs often missing is the infrastructure to support them.\nIn the U.S., that infrastructure is slowly taking shape. While early federal efforts like 18F and the U.S. Digital Service have scaled back, a decentralized civic tech ecosystem has emerged. State and local initiatives like California‚Äôs Office of Data and Innovation, New York City‚Äôs Mayor‚Äôs Office of Data Analytics, and the Colorado Digital Service embed technologists into government to modernize services. In the AI space, the GovAI Coalition‚Äîfounded by the City of San Jos√©‚Äîhelps public agencies promote ethical, transparent AI use by providing practical governance tools.\nA growing ecosystem of organizations is advancing civic tech through both service delivery and talent development. Code for America, Nava, and Propel deliver user-centered public services. Coding It Forward and the Partnership for Public Service support early-career technologists entering government. The Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) connects more than 50 universities training students at the intersection of technology and public purpose. These initiatives are supported by funders like the Knight, Hewlett, Ford, MacArthur, Gates, Walmart, and Schmidt Futures foundations.\nBut this kind of infrastructure is still rare outside the U.S. In South Korea, for example, there is no comparable ecosystem of civic tech organizations, no clear pathway into government tech work, and no long-term institutional support. The talent exists. The public need is obvious. But the platform to bring them together is missing.\nEven when civic tech projects emerge in Korea, they tend to be crisis-driven and temporary. During the early months of COVID-19, volunteer technologists built a map-based tool that helped people find nearby stores with available masks‚Äîallowing them to avoid long lines in the cold‚Äîand they created the ‚ÄúSafe Number‚Äù system to protect user privacy. The ‚ÄúSafe Number‚Äù system was introduced in South Korea during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect personal privacy while enabling contact tracing. At the time, people were required to provide their mobile numbers when entering restaurants, cafes, and public facilities. To address growing privacy concerns, technologists created an alternative: temporary, randomized phone numbers‚Äîso-called ‚ÄúSafe Numbers‚Äù‚Äîthat could be used in place of personal ones. These proxy numbers allowed health authorities to reach individuals if necessary, without exposing their real contact information to businesses or third parties.\nThese contributions were important, but these efforts were largely volunteer-driven and short-term. Civic tech in Korea remains framed as emergency response‚Äînot as a sustainable career path embedded in institutions and policy.\nThis lack of infrastructure shaped my own trajectory. Nearly two decades ago, I stumbled upon MIT OpenCourseWare while studying abroad in Hong Kong. At the time, I had been tutoring low-income students in Korea and was deeply contemplating the links between education access and economic inequality. Inspired, I launched a similar project in Korea by partnering with Professor Gyu-Tae Kim at Korea University to build an open learning platform.\nThat project introduced me to the global open knowledge movement and led me to become active in Creative Commons Korea, where I joined others working to make digital public infrastructure more accessible and equitable. Around the same time, I began writing as a tech journalist and op-ed contributor, publishing a series of columns on the social impacts of technology that later became the foundation of several books. My work in this space eventually led to an invitation from Naver‚Äîthe largest internet company in Korea, often called the ‚ÄúKorean Google‚Äù‚Äîto serve on its user service advisory board as both the youngest member and the only college student.\nYet despite this early work, I struggled to find a career path that sustained mission-driven, public interest technology. I briefly worked at a startup, but it didn‚Äôt lead to the kind of impact I was seeking. I decided to pursue a PhD in the U.S., supported by a Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies fellowship, with the goal of developing strong research skills and applying them to solve public problems. At Berkeley, I trained as both a political scientist and data scientist, combining theory, policy, and computation to better understand‚Äîand help address‚Äîsystems of inequality.\nIn 2020, I co-organized the Bay Area site of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science with the theme of connecting computational social scientists and Bay Area nonprofit organizations, including Code for America. Since then, I have closely followed their work‚Äîpartnering with governments, applying human-centered design, and building digital tools to improve access to the safety net.\nWhen I formally joined Code for America in 2023 as a data scientist, it felt like a return to where this journey had started‚Äîat the intersection of technology, policy, and social equity.\nThe Pipeline Still Needs Building\nThat same year, while working at Code for America, I published a book in Korea: We Need Civic Data: How Public Data Can Fail Us ‚Äî and How It Can Build a More Just Society (Sejong Books). It was the first book in Korean to explore civic data as a foundation for more equitable and responsive government. Drawing on examples from Korea and the U.S., the book outlines how data systems shape access to services‚Äîand how we can redesign them to serve the public good. I wrote it to help build the civic tech ecosystem in Korea. But there‚Äôs still a long way to go.\nMy path has taken me from open education in Korea to safety net service delivery in the U.S. But one question continues to guide me: how do we build a digital future rooted in public values?\nIn the U.S., we are beginning to see some answers. There are people, institutions, and entry points for technologists who want to serve the public. But in many countries, including my home country, these pathways are still missing. Many civic-minded technologists must stitch together their own careers‚Äîor leave. I‚Äôm not the only Korean who left the country to build a career in civic tech. Another is Wonyoung So, a former colleague from Korea‚Äôs public tech scene who is now a PhD candidate at MIT. He began his career in civic tech by co-founding a creative crowdfunding platform and curating citizen data projects in Seoul. Today, he studies how algorithms and AI reinforce housing inequality in the U.S.\nAs global concern grows over the power of technology‚Äîfrom misinformation and surveillance to algorithmic harm‚Äîwe must take deliberate steps to steer it in a more democratic, inclusive, and accountable direction. Achieving that goal requires many more people to engage in civic tech, especially from diverse communities, regions, and countries. Only then can we build a future that is truly just and global.\nTo build a global civic tech ecosystem, we can begin with a few concrete steps.\nFirst, we need to invest in local civic tech hubs that connect universities, nonprofits, and government agencies in sustained collaboration. The U.S. offers one example: initiatives like the Digital Service at the federal and local levels have demonstrated the value of embedding technical expertise within government.\nSecond, we should create more international fellowships, internships, and exchange programs‚Äîso technologists can not only serve beyond their borders but also bring back lessons that enrich their home institutions. Even in the U.S., there is much to learn from abroad. The U.S. Digital Service itself was inspired by the UK‚Äôs Government Digital Service, and countries like Taiwan have pioneered civic tech models centered on transparency, open-source collaboration, and participatory governance.\nFinally, we need to strengthen the connective tissue between these efforts. A global alliance of civic tech hubs could offer shared principles, ethical guidelines, and open standards that guide collaboration and adaptation across contexts. By investing in this distributed infrastructure, we can make civic tech more resilient, effective, and globally responsive.\nBuilding a global pipeline for civic tech isn‚Äôt just about training individuals‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating the conditions that make their work possible, valued, and enduring. That means treating infrastructure, institutions, and community not as afterthoughts, but as the foundation for lasting impact. If we want a future where technology serves democracy, we must invest in that pipeline‚Äîeverywhere.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "How to Build a Dissertation Committee",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Forming a dissertation committee is one of the most important‚Äîand stressful‚Äîtasks in a PhD program. From a faculty member‚Äôs perspective, especially at research-intensive institutions, research is the main responsibility, teaching is secondary, and advising is often optional. Supervising doctoral students takes time and care, but institutional incentives for doing so are usually limited. Professors take on advising roles not out of obligation, but because they see potential in a student and take personal interest in supporting their growth.\nFor students, however, the stakes are high. You can‚Äôt complete your doctorate without a dissertation committee‚Äîand you‚Äôll likely need strong letters from its members to get a job. People often say you ‚Äúchoose‚Äù your committee, but that doesn‚Äôt quite capture what‚Äôs really happening. It‚Äôs not simply about selecting names; it‚Äôs a matching process. You‚Äôre building a team of faculty members whose interests, expertise, and working styles align with your research needs. This requires mutual agreement, not just your own decision. Because advisors and students often enter the process with different expectations, committee formation can feel delicate, uncertain, and high-stakes all at once.\nSo what is a dissertation committee for? And how do you build a good one?\nHere are three insights I often share with doctoral students, especially in the social sciences.\nIt‚Äôs your dissertation‚Äîyou should lead it\nOne common challenge‚Äîespecially for students trained in more hierarchical academic systems like mine in South Korea‚Äîis shifting from a mindset of deference to one of ownership.\nYour dissertation is your project. You should be the one leading it. If your research were a startup, you‚Äôd be the founder. Your advisor would be a board member‚Äîexperienced, invested, and available for strategic guidance. But the core vision and key decisions are yours to make.\nHere‚Äôs what that looked like in my case:\n\nSetting meeting cadence: I took the lead in scheduling meetings with my committee. During the proposal stage, I proposed biweekly meetings. Later, when collecting data and writing, I spaced them out‚Äîmonthly, bimonthly, or by chapter‚Äîbased on the work that was ready for review.\nEfficient communication: A week before each meeting, I shared relevant materials. A day before, I sent a focused agenda. After the meeting, I sent a short summary. All of this was done to respect their time and make the most of each interaction.\nRunning the meeting: I framed the problem I was working on, explained my proposed solution (Plan A), and discussed its strengths and weaknesses. If my advisor had a different take, I presented Plan B. Sometimes we found a new Plan C together.\n\nWhy go to this length?\nTwo reasons:\n\nIt was my project‚Äîtaking initiative was part of the job.\n\nMy advisors were extremely busy, and I saw their time as my most valuable resource.\n\nYou don‚Äôt earn your committee‚Äôs respect by proving how smart you are. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one knows everything. What makes a real impression is how professionally you show up: being prepared, open to feedback, willing to be wrong, and committed to doing the hard work to improve your research. That‚Äôs how trust is built‚Äîand that trust matters most with your chair.\nYour chair is your most important ally\nYour dissertation chair is the most important member of your committee. This person should be someone who truly understands and appreciates your work‚Äîand who can challenge you and support you at the same time. A good chair knows when to push and when to wait, when to offer critique and when to stand behind you. A strong working relationship with your chair is essential‚Äîespecially because they will likely write your most important letter of recommendation when you go on the job market.\nStrong letters don‚Äôt just praise‚Äîthey translate your work and potential to others in your field. Your chair is typically best positioned to do this, especially if your dissertation is your primary research output at the time. That‚Äôs why it matters that your chair not only has expertise in your area, but also sees the value in what you‚Äôre doing and is invested in your growth.\nForm a lean committee that complements each other\nBeyond your chair, the role of other committee members can vary depending on your needs and how you work with them. Some may be strong in theory, others in methods. Some may be in your department and deeply familiar with program expectations; others may come from outside and bring a broader disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspective. Ideally, your committee members complement each other, offering a range of insights and support that strengthen your work from multiple angles.\nYou don‚Äôt need every expert in your field to sit on your formal committee. You can (and should) seek informal feedback from a wider group of scholars. Many successful dissertations are shaped by a small, cohesive committee and a broader network of mentors.\nThat‚Äôs why I often recommend building the smallest formal committee allowed by your program. A lean committee minimizes logistical complexity and the risk of internal conflict. It also gives you more freedom to shape your research network beyond the formal structure.\nOf course, you still need all committee members to approve your dissertation in the end. If you anticipate tensions or major disagreements between members, think carefully about how to manage or avoid those dynamics. In some cases, professors themselves will decline to serve together if they anticipate friction.\nFinal Thought: Treat your committee as professional collaborators\nOnce you begin your dissertation, you‚Äôre not just a student‚Äîyou‚Äôre a member of the research community. That means your advisors are not your bosses; they‚Äôre your most important collaborators.\nThis shift in mindset‚Äîtaking ownership of your work and leading your own project‚Äîwon‚Äôt make the dissertation process easy. It‚Äôs still a huge undertaking, full of uncertainty, and often very stressful. But approaching your committee professionally and proactively can make the challenges more manageable‚Äîand help you build the kind of relationships that support your growth far beyond the dissertation.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "The Ruth Collier Method: Teaching Scholarship with Courage and Clarity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I reflect on what shaped me most as a scholar, one seminar stands out: Ruth Collier‚Äôs dissertation writing workshop at Berkeley. Though she was technically semi-retired, her influence was unmistakable. Her course wasn‚Äôt flashy or heavily promoted, but everyone knew its reputation. If you were serious about writing a strong dissertation, you found your way into that room. Some students even came from other departments to take it.\nI took it twice: once early on, and again later in the dissertation writing stage. I wasn‚Äôt alone. Many of the best dissertations, award-winning papers, and eventual books passed through that seminar. Among Berkeley political science alumni, there‚Äôs a quiet fan club of Ruth Collier. Last year, I co-organized a happy hour at APSA just so we could swap Ruth stories.\nHer pedagogy was rigorous and remarkably consistent. Ruth cared deeply about her students‚Äîkind, generous, and attentive in ways that mattered‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt let you off the hook. Each student was expected to sign up to present at least twice per semester. The presenter would circulate a 5‚Äì6 page paper draft in advance, and everyone else came prepared to read it closely and provide comments. Ruth read everything‚Äîevery footnote, every endnote‚Äîand let you know, clearly and directly, if something didn‚Äôt make sense. You would get the most honest and demanding feedback, and also the most clear-eyed and generous encouragement. She saw the potential in drafts you were ready to abandon and pushed you toward it without letting you take shortcuts.\nA good scholar, she modeled, must be curious, dedicated, and deeply caring for the craft. And as Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote in Letters to a Young Poet, she helped us go deeper within ourselves and find strength there we didn‚Äôt know we had. That‚Äôs what her push was for.\nOne of the most distinctive parts of her method was what happened when you couldn‚Äôt explain your idea clearly. If you were struggling‚Äîmumbling through a mechanism, circling around a concept‚ÄîRuth would stop you. ‚ÄúGo to the board,‚Äù she‚Äôd say. At least once per semester, each of us had to stand up and diagram our core argument. ‚ÄúDraw the idea. Show me how it works.‚Äù It was the ultimate test. If you couldn‚Äôt diagram it, you didn‚Äôt yet understand it. The exercise was uncomfortable, sometimes even humbling‚Äîbut it was clarifying. It forced us to confront the fuzziness in our thinking. It sharpened our ideas and made our arguments more honest and more our own.\nOver time, many of us developed what we jokingly called our ‚Äúinner Ruth‚Äù‚Äîthe voice that told you when a sentence wasn‚Äôt clear enough, when a claim wasn‚Äôt grounded, when a paragraph was faking it. That voice didn‚Äôt go away after the course ended. It became part of how we wrote and how we thought.\nRuth‚Äôs brilliance wasn‚Äôt just in her intellectual depth‚Äîthough she studied at least three world regions (Latin America, Europe, and Africa) and could move fluently between them. It was in how she trained us to think with precision and write with integrity. She asked us to tell the truth, in our own voices, to the audiences that mattered. She didn‚Äôt just teach us how to write better. She taught us to know what we were trying to say‚Äîand why.\nIn doing all this, Ruth created a space that was both rigorous and supportive, demanding and caring. It was a place where it was safe to take risks, and expected that you would. Her workshop trained us to write dissertations, yes‚Äîbut more than that, it taught us how to do scholarship with clarity, honesty, and courage.\nLooking back, I‚Äôve often wondered why her class was so influential. In graduate school, you learn theory, methods, and cases from many people. But it‚Äôs not easy to find an intellectual role model. Ruth was that for me‚Äîand for many of us. Perhaps that‚Äôs also why I won‚Äôt, and couldn‚Äôt, forget her lessons. She didn‚Äôt just tell us what scholarship should be. She showed us.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Some memories fade as we grow older; others come into sharper focus. As my late father‚Äôs memorial day approaches, one conversation remains crystal clear‚Äîthe one I had with him on my wedding day.\nIt was a few hours before the ceremony. We were sitting side by side in a hair salon, the stylist adding a final touch to my hair while rain slid down the window, when he began to speak. He told me‚Äîagain‚Äîhow my grandfather had forbidden him to attend college because, as the youngest son, he was expected to stay close to home. My father had been so frail that my grandfather even renamed him Myungryul‚Äî‚Äúlong life‚Äù‚Äîhoping the new characters would protect him.\nHe mounted a quiet rebellion, choosing numbers and circuits over rows of crops and spending thirty-two years as an electrician in a paper mill‚Äîone of the few outlets for his talent. In doing so, he escaped the rural life he was born into, but not the hardships etched into his path. Factory floors in Korea then were unforgiving: the pounding machines slowly stole hearing in one ear, and decades of dust and chemical haze‚Äîhis likely suspects, since he neither smoked nor drank‚Äîmay have seeded the cancer that would eventually take his life.\nWhen we talked that rainy morning, I had graduated from college and was working at a software start-up. Tech circles claimed they would ‚Äúrevolutionize‚Äù the world, while most products really just chased a few extra ad clicks. The louder the talk grew, the more skeptical I became. I wanted to answer even a single question properly, and that meant learning how to do research. Graduate school felt remote to someone from a working-class family, yet I applied for‚Äîand received‚Äîthe Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies scholarship, one of the most prestigious and competitive fellowships in Korea, awarded that year to only two political science students to support their PhD studies abroad. My father was excited about the news and about my marriage to my girlfriend, a year older and already thriving in an engineering career he himself might have loved. In us, he saw the opportunities he had once dreamed of: in me, an education reaching beyond the farm and factory floor; in her, a career shaped by mathematical skill and a passion for engineering.\nHe often said his greatest regret was letting his dream slip away and that he had no fixed plan for my career‚Äîonly the hope I would follow my own path. I remember that conversation not just because of the rain‚Äôs hush, but because it was almost our last real talk. A few months later, cancer took him.\nI moved to the United States and earned a PhD in political science at UC Berkeley. We hadn‚Äôt always seen eye to eye, but I dedicated my dissertation to him, hoping he might somehow know his sacrifices were acknowledged. After completing my degree, I began my career as a researcher and data scientist, always mindful of the path that brought me here. Today I‚Äôm often surrounded by people whose backgrounds rarely resemble mine‚Äîbut I‚Äôve never forgotten my father, our conversation on that rainy morning, or the dream he was never able to pursue.\nIt has been more than ten years since he passed away. I can no longer clearly recall his face or the exact sound of his voice. But I remember that conversation‚Äîthe pain I felt, the sorrow I saw, and the regret I heard. That memory stays with me, sharper than any photograph, and it shapes the work I do.\nResearch is powered by curiosity, theory, and data‚Äîbut for me it is also anchored in mission. That mission is personal: to stay with the hard, determined work of adding even a small measure of dignity for people like my father‚Äîpeople who rarely set foot on a college campus, who celebrated their children‚Äôs chances while quietly carrying the weight of doors closed to them. While studying poverty and inequality in the U.S., my adopted home, I saw their struggles firsthand, spoke with them directly, listened to their stories, and learned from them, each one a reminder of my father. Not everyone will sit in university lecture halls, but everyone deserves research that begins with their lives, listens to their stories, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîserves them.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "How Opportunities Travel: A Guide to Academic Networking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Networking isn‚Äôt optional in academia‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. I didn‚Äôt come to this realization naturally. I‚Äôm not someone who thrives on large social events or group dinners. In fact, I avoided most school functions as an undergraduate in Korea. I preferred spending time alone‚Äîrunning outdoors during the day, listening to music, cooking, or reading at home in the evenings.\nIn the course of building my career, though, I learned that opportunities don‚Äôt come from effort and talent alone. They come when your work is known‚Äîand remembered‚Äîby people who can open doors. That only happens if you‚Äôre willing to show up, ask questions, and build relationships. Not once, but again and again.\nThis isn‚Äôt always intuitive, especially for international students or first-generation scholars. But networking is a skill. It can be learned, practiced, and improved.\nHere are five lessons that helped me‚Äîand may help you too.\n1. Define your value\nAcademic networking starts before you reach out to anyone. It begins with understanding what you have to offer‚Äîand what you‚Äôre genuinely curious about. Before writing to someone, ask: If I were in their position, why would I want to meet me?\nThat reflection shapes everything: your message, your tone, even your questions.\nWhen I email someone I admire, I try to connect my interests to theirs in a way that‚Äôs specific and sincere. Sometimes I point to an overlap in topics or methods. Sometimes I reference a paper or book of theirs I found particularly useful. Either way, I do my homework‚Äîand I make it easy for them to see why a short meeting could be worthwhile.\nA message that shows you‚Äôve engaged with their work‚Äîand have something meaningful to discuss‚Äîis far more compelling than a list of accomplishments.\nPeople are busy. But most are also generous‚Äîespecially when they can tell you‚Äôve made the effort to reach out thoughtfully.\n2. Lower the stakes\nProfessors are busy. Postdocs and grad students are too, but faculty often carry additional institutional responsibilities‚Äîadvising students, writing recommendation letters, serving on committees, and helping lead their departments.\nSo keep your messages short. Really short.\nStart with one short paragraph explaining why you appreciate their work. Be specific‚Äîa paper you found helpful, a talk that stayed with you, a project you admire.\nFollow with a second paragraph briefly introducing yourself and what you‚Äôre working on, especially if it connects to their interests.\nThen close with a third paragraph politely asking if they might have 30 minutes to meet. Keep the tone low-pressure, and frame it as a conversation rather than a favor.\nIf they offer a few time slots, try your best to accommodate. Don‚Äôt ask them to rearrange their day around yours. And once you agree on a time, send a calendar invite to help keep things smooth. These small gestures go a long way toward making a good impression before you‚Äôve even spoken.\nAnd if you don‚Äôt hear back? That‚Äôs normal. Don‚Äôt take it personally. Sometimes I follow up the next year by saying, ‚ÄúI reached out last time but didn‚Äôt get a chance to connect‚ÄîI‚Äôd still love to talk if you‚Äôre open.‚Äù That approach has led to some of my most valuable conversations.\n3. Be a service to others\nNetworking doesn‚Äôt begin or end with asking for advice. Often, the most durable academic relationships begin when you create value for others.\nIn 2019, during my Ph.D.¬†at UC Berkeley, I attended the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science at Princeton. The organizers encouraged participants to help expand the program‚Äôs reach. So the following year, I volunteered to co-organize a new site in the Bay Area, hosted by Berkeley and Stanford.\nThat small act‚Äîorganizing something for others‚Äîconnected me with dozens of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students across disciplines. Many of them have since become coauthors, collaborators, and close colleagues. It also brought me into contact with Code for America, a civic tech nonprofit we invited to collaborate. That one encounter eventually led to a full-time job as a data scientist there.\nI didn‚Äôt think of networking as a way to advance my career. I thought of it as a way to contribute. Being useful‚Äîwithout expecting anything back‚Äîoften does more to build lasting relationships than any self-serving approach ever could. And usefulness tends to be remembered.\nYou don‚Äôt have to organize a conference to do this. You can offer feedback on a draft, amplify someone‚Äôs work online, or help coordinate a small reading group. Small contributions often lead to deeper connections.\n4. Build your board of advisors\nNetworking isn‚Äôt a one-time push‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifelong process of relationship-building. Some people become mentors. Others become mentees. Some become friends, coauthors, or informal sounding boards.\nIn the course of building my career, I‚Äôve come to think of this as building a ‚Äúpersonal advisory board.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just about your dissertation committee. You need different kinds of support at different stages: people who understand the job market, others who can give feedback on early-stage ideas, and others who can help you navigate big career transitions.\nAnd it‚Äôs not just reciprocal. You rise higher when you lift others along the way. The strongest networks are built on shared success, not competition.\n5. Treat it as a skill‚Äînot a trait\nI didn‚Äôt grow up thinking I was good at networking. I still don‚Äôt love big receptions or happy hours. But I‚Äôve learned how to build relationships in ways that feel authentic to me. And that‚Äôs the point‚Äîthere‚Äôs no single right way to do this.\nWhat matters is that you keep showing up, keep learning, and stay open to connection.\nNetworking is how opportunities travel. Talent matters. So does timing. But often, it‚Äôs a conversation that turns effort into momentum.\nAnd like any skill, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "What Running Taught Me: How to Fail and How to Grow Old",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Starting Over\nIn early 2020, I took up running seriously. Before that, I had been a martial arts enthusiast‚Äîtraining in Taekwondo and Wushu at Berkeley‚Äîand a regular at the gym. But once my first child was born, those habits quietly slipped away. I didn‚Äôt have the time, energy, or flexibility anymore.\nThen the pandemic hit. Like many others, I suddenly found myself with a new rhythm of life. My long commutes disappeared, and I decided to reclaim that time by lacing up my shoes and heading out for a run.\nAt first, I approached running the way I approached my work: with structure, intensity, and goal-setting. I tracked my pace, set mileage targets, and pushed myself to improve. But over time‚Äîand with many sore muscles and unmet goals‚ÄîI began to let go of that mindset. I stopped chasing numbers. I started running for how it made me feel.\nRunning as Meditation\nThese days, I run four to five times a week, usually covering 10 to 15 kilometers (around 6 to 9 miles). I‚Äôm not fast, and my form isn‚Äôt graceful. But I run anyway. Because I‚Äôve learned that none of that matters.\nRunning calms my mind. It gives my thoughts a place to go. When I focus on my breath, the rhythm of my steps, and the steady beat of my heart, I find something rare: quiet. A kind of stillness I don‚Äôt often experience in the rest of my day. What began as a form of exercise has become something else entirely‚Äîa moving meditation.\nAnd in that meditative space, I‚Äôve learned how to fail. And how to grow old.\nLearning How to Fail\nResearch‚Äîespecially academic research‚Äîis built on failure. Every researcher knows this, but that doesn‚Äôt make it easier. From the first days of graduate school, I‚Äôve faced rejection: papers, grants, jobs. Each one stings. But over time, I‚Äôve learned something that running helped crystallize: to grow, you have to take risks. And to take risks, you have to accept failure.\nWhen I first started running, I set goals that mimicked the metrics of success in my professional life‚Äîspeed, distance, consistency. But the more I pushed myself to meet those metrics, the less joy I found. It wasn‚Äôt until I let go of those measures that I discovered the real value of running. Not in what I achieved, but in how I showed up.\nNow, when I run, I don‚Äôt worry about how fast or far I go. I focus on the experience: breathing well, landing lightly, staying present. If I run slower today than yesterday, that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll run again tomorrow. The same lesson applies to work. I still set goals. But once I‚Äôm working, I don‚Äôt obsess over outcomes. I focus on process, on learning, on flow.\nAs Haruki Murakami wrote in his running memoir, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, the goal is to keep going‚Äîday after day, with purpose and humility. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve learned to fail. And to keep moving.\nLearning How to Grow Old\nThe other lesson running has taught me is how to age‚Äînot passively, but deliberately.\nAs much as I loved martial arts, it started taking a toll. I got injured more easily. Recovery took longer. I found myself wondering if I could keep pushing my body the same way I had in my twenties. The honest answer was no.\nBut instead of resisting the inevitable, I started adapting. Running became a new kind of practice‚Äîone that matched the season of life I was entering. I don‚Äôt train to compete. I run to stay connected to my body. To feel my lungs expand and my feet lift off the ground. To remind myself that I‚Äôm still here, still learning, still alive.\nI ran my first official half marathon at the San Francisco Marathon in 2021. In 2024, I ran the Berkeley Half Marathon‚Äîduring the academic job market, no less. In 2025, I‚Äôll run my first full marathon, back where it started: San Francisco.\nSince 2020, I‚Äôve run nearly everywhere I‚Äôve lived or traveled: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe, Honolulu, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and in South Korea‚ÄîSeoul, Sejong, and Daejeon. In Canada, I‚Äôve run in both Montreal, Quebec and Vancouver, British Columbia‚Äîon opposite coasts.\nEach run etched something into my memory and left something in my body. Between official races, I‚Äôve kept going: many self-paced half marathons, and more than a few beyond the half mark.\nThe Road Ahead\nRunning didn‚Äôt just give me a new habit. It gave me a philosophy.\nI‚Äôve learned to let go of perfection and embrace consistency. I‚Äôve learned that failure isn‚Äôt a detour‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the path. I‚Äôve learned that aging isn‚Äôt something to fight, but something to navigate with care.\nAs long as my legs can carry me, I‚Äôll keep running. I‚Äôll keep working. I‚Äôll keep finding joy in the rhythm of small, deliberate steps‚Äîon the road and in life.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "How to Write a Statement of Purpose for Graduate School in Political Science\nI used to joke that I‚Äôm lazy‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like repeating myself. So whenever I find myself giving the same advice more than a few times, I write it down. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked with many students‚Äîespecially those from marginalized backgrounds or non-traditional academic paths‚Äîwho are preparing their statement of purpose (SOP) for graduate school in political science. I‚Äôve written this guide with them in mind.\nThe tips that follow don‚Äôt represent a universal formula. Every applicant, every reviewer, and every program is different. But these are principles I‚Äôve seen help students write with clarity, confidence, and purpose.\n1. You‚Äôre not just a candidate‚Äîyou‚Äôre a solution to a problem\nPut yourself in the shoes of an admissions committee member. They‚Äôre reading dozens, sometimes hundreds of applications. What are they looking for? Not just talent, but alignment. Not just promise, but purpose. They want to understand how you fit into the intellectual ecosystem they‚Äôre building.\nOne way to show that is to present yourself as a researcher in formation‚Äîsomeone who has found a problem in the field that matters, and who is ready to begin solving it. In that sense, research is a little like entrepreneurship: the most compelling projects create value. For us, that means identifying an important and unsolved puzzle in the literature and showing how your perspective, method, or data could move it forward.\nThe problem doesn‚Äôt have to be groundbreaking. In fact, most good research builds by remixing‚Äîlinking literatures that rarely speak to each other, applying a method to a new context, or introducing overlooked data. The key is to show how you arrived at your puzzle, and how your background (academic, professional, personal) gives you a unique lens to address it.\n2. Signpost your argument‚Äîdon‚Äôt make them hunt for it\nWriting a good SOP is as much about structure as substance. Admissions readers are busy. Help them understand who you are, what you‚Äôre proposing, and why it matters‚Äîquickly and clearly.\nThere‚Äôs a loose but reliable structure that most SOPs follow:\n\nHook: A personal or intellectual moment that motivates your research interest.\nGap: A puzzle or tension in the literature you want to address.\nDesign: How you plan to tackle it‚Äîyour research question, approach, or early ideas.\nQualifications: What experiences have prepared you to do this work.\nFit: Why this program, and what you hope to learn from it.\n\nThink of it like a well-crafted pitch. By the end, the committee shouldn‚Äôt just think you‚Äôre smart or hardworking‚Äîevery applicant is. They should think: this person is working on a problem that matters, and our department can help them do it well.\n3. Don‚Äôt write like you‚Äôre trying to impress‚Äîwrite like you‚Äôre trying to connect\nAvoid the temptation to overuse technical jargon. You‚Äôre not writing to prove how much you know‚Äîyou‚Äôre writing to show what kind of researcher you‚Äôre becoming. And the most effective researchers are often the clearest communicators.\nWrite like a journalist, not a lawyer. Assume your reader is an intelligent, curious upper-level undergraduate: they‚Äôre sharp, but not steeped in the specifics of your subfield. Signal expertise through clarity, not complexity. Jargon isn‚Äôt a sin, but if it gets in the way of your argument, it‚Äôs not helping you.\nThe best SOPs are accessible, focused, and grounded in real curiosity. They don‚Äôt beg to be taken seriously‚Äîthey make it easy to do so.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The Shift\nBy the end of my second year in graduate school, I made a quiet but decisive shift: I moved from comparative to American politics. It wasn‚Äôt part of any grand plan. I just started to notice something. American scholars were often seen as experts on the politics of other countries‚Äîbut rarely the other way around. I wanted to challenge that asymmetry. I believed international students like me also had something to say about American politics. We carried perspectives shaped by distance and difference. That, I thought, could be a contribution‚Äînot a liability.\nBut the moment I entered that conversation, I felt what it meant to be on the outside. I began attending seminars and workshops where I was often the only non-native English speaker‚Äîand one of the only racial or ethnic minorities in the room. The feeling of not quite belonging wasn‚Äôt imagined. It was structural, social, and deeply personal.\nThe Hurt\nArticulating complex ideas in a second‚Äîor third‚Äîlanguage isn‚Äôt just hard. It can be humiliating. The real challenge isn‚Äôt grammar or vocabulary. It‚Äôs knowing, deep down, that someone in the room is already questioning your intellect before you‚Äôve finished your sentence. I didn‚Äôt need training in social psychology to know this was happening. Over the years, I heard it directly from people I respected‚Äîcomments about my accent, my word choice, or the way I sounded ‚Äúless certain.‚Äù\nThe first time it happened, it felt like a punch to the stomach. I tried to let it go. But those moments stay with you. They resurface in quiet hours. They chip away at your confidence. I don‚Äôt believe those colleagues were malicious. I think they were unaware. But even casual comments, when repeated often enough, add up. One remark may seem harmless. But when you hear it enough, it becomes something sharp. A thousand paper cuts, quietly accumulated.\nThe Turn\nAt some point, I wrote down what I was feeling. I shared an early version of this reflection while I was still in graduate school‚Äîstill unsure if I truly belonged. I braced for silence. But something unexpected happened instead.\nPeople reached out. Political scientists from across the field wrote to me. They offered mentorship, solidarity, support. Some of them became mentors who opened doors I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Others became collaborators, allies, friends. Their kindness helped me finish my degree. But more than that, it helped me believe that I had a place in this field‚Äînot as an exception, but as someone who belonged.\nThe Why\nThat experience changed how I show up in academia. These days, whenever I attend a conference, I extend a simple invitation: Let me buy you a coffee or tea. If you‚Äôre a graduate student‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre international, a minority, or unsure of your place‚Äîplease reach out. I‚Äôve mentored dozens of students across backgrounds, inside and outside academia. I do it because others did it for me. And because no one should have to navigate this alone.\nI also carry that mindset into my teaching. I work hard to create spaces where students from non-traditional backgrounds can find their footing, develop their skills, and feel seen. I want them to know what I often didn‚Äôt: that their voice, however it sounds, is something to protect‚Äînot correct.\nThe Ask\nIf you‚Äôre a political scientist reading this, thank you. And I have one request: if you believe, as I do, that our field should be more inclusive and open to different ways of speaking, thinking, and being, then be mindful of how you talk about language. Please don‚Äôt write comments like ‚ÄúThe author is not a native speaker.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt help. It doesn‚Äôt improve the work. It just narrows the space of who gets to be taken seriously.\nWe don‚Äôt need more subtle signals of exclusion. We need more acts of generosity. Sometimes that means offering a second read. Sometimes it means choosing silence over critique. And sometimes it means using your voice to help someone else find theirs.\nThe Lesson\nBecause at the end of the day, doing scholarship isn‚Äôt just about publishing. It‚Äôs about belonging. It‚Äôs about finding your voice‚Äîand finding the people who help you keep it. That‚Äôs what makes the work sustainable. That‚Äôs what makes it matter.\nAnd that‚Äôs the kind of field I want to help build‚Äîone conversation, one gesture, one shared cup of coffee at a time.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Academic Job Talks as Storytelling: Why Character Matters as Much as Plot",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After delivering my practice job talk, a colleague gave me an important piece of feedback: ‚ÄúThis is a good research talk, but it‚Äôs not enough for a job talk.‚Äù At the time, I was not sure what that meant. I had worked hard to organize the research clearly, present the methods carefully, and explain the findings in detail. Wasn‚Äôt that what a job talk was supposed to do?\nOver time, I came to understand. A research talk is about communicating results. A job talk is about something more. It is about convincing a group of future colleagues that you are someone they want to invest in, work with, and build a department around. A good job talk does not simply tell a story about the research; it reveals something about the person behind the research. Departments are not only hiring a project. They are hiring a person.\nThinking this way helped me see the job talk differently. It is not only about the plot‚Äîthe data, the models, the results. It is about the character‚Äîthe decisions you made in designing the research, the curiosity that drove your inquiry, the way you deliver your ideas, and the potential for future work. A job talk is storytelling, and you are at the center of that story.\nBased on this experience, I found it helpful to keep six principles in mind as I prepared my job talks.\n1. It‚Äôs Not About You\nIt is easy to fixate on your own anxieties‚Äîwhether about your slide design, the complexity of your methods, or the depth of your technical explanations. But what you worry about is often not what the audience cares about. Departments are asking different questions: Is this person good at what they do? Do they show potential for future growth? Are they a good fit for our department and students? A strong job talk addresses these questions.\nIt is important to remember that many faculty members will only encounter you through your job talk, either live or recorded. Even if the search committee recommends you, the wider faculty vote determines the final outcome. In that vote, the impression you make during the talk matters enormously. You cannot assume detailed familiarity with your field or topic. You must meet them where they are: curious, distracted, and busy.\nThere is no such thing as a perfect job talk. Perfection is neither possible nor the standard by which talks are judged. Evaluations are subjective, shaped by departmental needs, interests, and individual perspectives. What matters is not achieving perfection, but delivering a clear, compelling story that leaves colleagues curious and confident about you.\n2. Your Character Matters as Much as Your Plot\nYour research project is important, but it is only part of the story. Departments are evaluating the person behind the project. They want to see intellectual curiosity, creativity, resilience, and collaborative potential. A brilliant paper will not carry a job talk if the audience cannot imagine you thriving as a colleague. Think of your talk as showing, not just telling, who you are as a scholar.\n3. Tell One Clear Story\nIn a room of busy, easily distracted audience members, you need both clarity and substance‚Äîenough detail to inform, but never so much that you lose their attention. From the very beginning, frame why your research matters. Help the audience understand what is at stake and why they should care. Once they are invested, walk them through the key challenges and choices with focus. Return often to your central message so even latecomers and distracted listeners can stay with you.\nA good job talk is not a data dump. It is a focused narrative built around one clear takeaway‚Äîwhy this work matters, why it matters now, and why you are the one to do it.\nBecause most people will only retain one idea, you must decide what that one idea should be‚Äîand repeat it throughout the talk.\n4. Show, Don‚Äôt Tell\nSlides should support the story, not overwhelm it. Whenever possible, show with images or figures instead of long text. Keep words minimal and fonts large enough to be read from the back of the room. Avoid clutter: even small labels like ‚ÄúFigure 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúTable 2‚Äù should be trimmed when possible.\nNever read your slides. A presenter who reads appears unprepared, and once that impression forms, it is difficult to reverse. Use slides to highlight what is hard to say in words, not as a script.\nTrying to cover too much often leads to rushing, and rushing almost always weakens the talk.\n5. Practice Until You Become the Story\nDo at least three full practice talks before your first flyout‚Äîonce you hit the road, it‚Äôs much harder to find opportunities to rehearse. The first run surfaces structural gaps, the second refines your narrative, and the third perfects your delivery.\nBefore each practice, tell your audience what kind of feedback you want and how you prefer to receive it‚Äîemail, shared documents, or live comments. Recording your practice talks can also help you track which questions arise and how you handle them.\nYou don‚Äôt need to answer every possible question during the talk itself. Some can be reserved for Q&A, where you can guide the discussion toward your strengths. Preparing appendix slides for anticipated questions is a good strategy. If the host allows it, it‚Äôs often better to let questions come during the talk. Being able to engage flexibly without losing your thread leaves a strong impression.\nPractice until your delivery feels second nature‚Äîknowing your key message, your narrative flow, your slide transitions, and your plan for handling expected questions with ease.\n6. Managing Nerves: Anxiety Is Your Friend Until It Becomes Toxic\nFeeling nervous is normal. In fact, mild anxiety sharpens focus and prepares you for performance. But if anxiety becomes overwhelming, it can hurt your delivery.\nI found it helpful to build small rituals before speaking: deep breathing, counting backwards from ten, bringing warm tea in a spill-proof tumbler, and preparing backups of my slides on multiple devices. I brought two suits with me in case something happened to one. That was what worked for me, though I know others will have different preferences when it comes to professional attire. Predicting and managing small risks helped keep nerves under control.\nThe point is not to eliminate nervousness, but to keep it manageable. With enough preparation, your nerves become energy, not a burden.\n\nLooking back, I am grateful for the colleague who pushed me to see the difference between a research talk and a job talk. Understanding that difference changed not only how I prepared but also how I presented myself. Strong research is necessary. But in the end, it is the story of who you are, and who you are becoming, that leaves the lasting impression.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Scheduled Teaching in Public Policy (UNC-CH)\n\nThe Politics of Public Policy\nPublic policy does not end with the passage of legislation. While policy design often attracts the most attention, the implementation phase‚Äîwhere political decisions are translated into administrative action‚Äîfrequently unfolds in relative silence. This course seeks to unveil that curtain. It examines how political institutions, political behavior, and bureaucratic politics shape the ways policies are interpreted, delivered, and experienced in practice.\nBuilding on both classical and recent scholarship in political science and public administration, the course re-centers implementation as a political process. Rather than treating it as a technical afterthought, we explore how administrative burdens‚Äîthe learning, compliance, and psychological costs of interacting with the state‚Äîare produced through a layered architecture of policy design, bureaucratic discretion, and frontline decision-making. This perspective highlights how implementation failures are not merely managerial breakdowns but reflect broader institutional and political dynamics.\nStudents analyze three interrelated dimensions of policy implementation:\n\nPolitical institutions, including federalism, separation of powers, and administrative procedures\n\nPolitical behavior, such as public opinion, policy framing, and participation\n\nBureaucratic politics, including agency discretion, frontline decision-making, and administrative capacity\n\nSpecial attention is paid to how inequality is reproduced or contested through everyday encounters with the state, and how implementation challenges can be addressed through better design, coordination, and accountability mechanisms.\nThe course adapts to different levels of study:\n\nFor undergraduates, it introduces foundational concepts and real-world cases that reveal the political significance of implementation. Case studies will draw on contemporary issues in health, welfare, education, and digital service delivery.\nFor Master of Public Policy (MPP) students, it emphasizes applied analysis and equips students with conceptual and diagnostic tools to assess and navigate implementation challenges across government systems.\nFor PhD students, the course engages deeply with theoretical and empirical literature on administrative burden, political institutions, and street-level governance. Doctoral students will use a macro‚Äìmeso‚Äìmicro framework to develop original research questions and contribute to scholarly debates on the politics of implementation.\n\n\n\n\nPotential Future Courses at the Intersection of Public Policy and Data Science (UNC-CH)\n\nThe following three courses form an integrated sequence in public policy data science, grounded in a domain-first approach. Rather than treating data science as a purely technical endeavor, the sequence begins with the policy problems themselves‚Äîemphasizing how data, computation, and artificial intelligence can be used in context to advance the public good. Each course explores a distinct but complementary dimension of data-informed governance‚Äîfrom algorithmic decision-making to digital service delivery and researcher-practitioner collaboration. Together, they prepare students to critically and creatively engage with the expanding role of data and AI in the policy process, equipping them with the analytical skills, institutional understanding, and ethical grounding needed to design, implement, and evaluate data- and AI-driven solutions to public problems.\n\nData, Algorithms, and AI for Public Policy\n\nThis course introduces students to the promises and risks of data-driven, algorithmic, and AI-enabled decision-making in the public sector. Through cases in social policy, criminal justice, and public health, students critically assess how algorithms and machine learning models are used to allocate resources, automate decisions, and influence policy outcomes. Particular attention is given to the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including issues of opacity, bias, and institutional accountability. The course emphasizes frameworks for evaluating and designing algorithmic and AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with the goals and constraints of public governance.\n\nCivic Tech and Digital Public Service\n\nThis course examines how public agencies use technology, data, artificial intelligence, and human-centered design to deliver more accessible, efficient, and equitable services. Students explore the role of digital platforms‚Äîsuch as websites, mobile applications, chatbots, and AI-powered tools‚Äîin shaping citizen experiences with government. The course highlights civic technology approaches rooted in participatory design and administrative burden reduction, while also addressing emerging questions about the use of AI in service delivery, including transparency, user autonomy, and algorithmic accountability. Emphasis is placed on how digital and AI-enabled tools can be designed to enhance‚Äînot replace‚Äîhuman judgment, trust, and inclusion in public programs.\n\nEvidence in Action: Partnering for Public Impact\n\nThis course examines how data scientists and policy researchers can work in partnership with public sector organizations to build actionable evidence and improve service delivery. Students learn to scope policy-relevant questions, design and implement applied analyses, and communicate results to diverse audiences and stakeholders. The course introduces the SIMC framework (Scoping, Implementation, Measurement, and Communication) as a practical guide for navigating the tensions between research rigor and institutional constraints. Through case studies in safety net programs and other public systems, students explore how political, organizational, and ethical factors shape the collaborative process and use of evidence for public impact.\n\n\n\n Courses Taught (UC Berkeley, KDI School, etc)\n\n\nGraduate Seminars\n\nKDI School of Public Policy and Management\n\nR Fundamentals for Public Policy (Spring 2022, Fall 2022)\nData Visualization and Communication (Summer 2022)\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nIntroduction to Computational Tools for Social Science\n\nInstructor of record: Spring 2019, Spring 2021\n\nGraduate Student Instructor (GSI): Fall 2016 (with Rachel Bernhard)\n\nDigital Data Collection Workshop (Fall 2020, with Nick Kuipers)\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Lectures\n\nIntroduction to Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Methods (UC Berkeley, Fall 2016)\n\nGSI for Laura Stoker\n\nOutstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-conference Tutorials\n\n\nIC2S2 (2024): Training CSS PhDs for Academic & Non-Academic Careers\nSICSS-Howard (2021): R Bootcamp ‚Äì Invited Instructor\n\n\n\n\nWorkshops (Selected)\n\n\nSummer Institute in Migration Research Methods, UC Berkeley (2024) ‚Äì Invited Instructor\n\nDigital Data Collection, Korea University (2022) ‚Äì Invited Instructor\n\nUC Berkeley D-Lab (2020‚Äì2021):\n\nFairness and Bias in Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning in R\n\nSQL for R Users\n\nFunctional Programming in R\n\nR Package Development\n\nAdvanced Data Wrangling\n\nProject Management in R\n\nR Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\n\nGuest Lectures (Selected)\n\n\n2025 ‚Äì Johns Hopkins: NLP for CSS\n\n2024 ‚Äì Johns Hopkins: Democracy by the Numbers\n\n2023 ‚Äì Wesleyan: Democracy in East Asia\n\n2022 ‚Äì National University of Singapore, KAIST, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University\n\n2021 ‚Äì KAIST, Dartmouth\n\n\n\n\nPedagogical Publications and Resources\n\n\nTextbook: Computational Thinking for Social Scientists\nAn open-access textbook (CC BY‚ÄëNC‚ÄëSA 4.0) that equips social scientists with modern computational skills: reproducible workflows (Git, Bash, tidy data), functional programming in R, data product development, semi-structured data collection, computational text analysis, predictive modeling, and database management with SQL.
