::: {#hero-heading}

I am an Assistant Research Scientist at the [SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/), where I co-developed the [Mapping the Modern Agora Project](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/project/mapping-the-modern-agora/). I am also a Research Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and a Fellow at the [Better Government Lab](https://www.bettergovernmentlab.org/our-team), based at Georgetown’s McCourt School and Michigan’s Ford School. Starting in January 2026, I will join the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill as an Assistant Professor of Public Policy.

My research examines how governments and communities build the capacity to implement public policy effectively. I focus on urban, social, and technology policy in the United States—studying how public institutions reduce administrative burdens in safety net programs and how civic infrastructure supports democratic governance. I use computational and multi-method approaches, including field experiments, surveys, big data analytics, and machine learning. I collaborate closely with government and nonprofit partners to produce research that directly informs policy and improves practice.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org/programs/), where I partnered with federal, state, and local agencies to expand access to safety net programs. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from UC Berkeley.

I am also a co-founder of the [Data for Good Roundtables](https://sites.google.com/view/d4g-roundtables?usp=sharing), a safe space where academics and practitioners come together to discuss using data for good.

My research has been published in *Nature Human Behaviour*, *Journal of Policy Analysis and Management*, *Nature Scientific Data*, *Perspectives on Politics* [2x], *Political Research Quarterly* [2x], *Journal of Experimental Political Science*, and *Studies in American Political Development*, among others.

I am the recipient of the APSA Emerging Scholar Award in Civic Engagement (2024), the APSA Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics (2022), and the WPSA Best Paper Award in Asian Pacific American Politics (2020).
