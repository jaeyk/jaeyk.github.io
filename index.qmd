::: {#hero-heading}

I am an assistant research scientist at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University and a research fellow at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School. 

Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist at [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org/programs/), where I collaborated with all levels of the U.S. government to improve access to safety net programs. 

I completed my PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2021. My research has been published in top outlets such as *Nature Human Behaviour* and received multiple awards from the American Political Science Association.

I study how the state and marginalized populations interact in American politics and policy, with a focus on policy implementation (**state capacity**) and community organizing and collective action (**civic capacity**). My research agenda bridges the social and behavioral sciences and data science and is grounded in people’s everyday experiences accessing public services and solving collective problems. I specialize in use-inspired research based on partnerships with government agencies. In addition, I have extensive experience building original, large-scale, and multi-purpose databases using big data and machine learning/AI. One example is [the Mapping the Modern Agora project](https://histphil.org/2024/01/25/the-uneven-landscape-of-civic-opportunity-in-the-united-states-what-we-discovered-while-mapping-the-modern-agora/), which maps the U.S. civil society at scale utilizing more than 1.8 million IRS tax returns, 1.1 million websites, and other digital trace data of nonprofit organizations.

In addition to my substantive interests, through my work on **computational social science** and **data science pedagogy**, I am actively engaged in bridging social sciences and data science and making computational methods accessible. 

I am currently working on a book version of my award-winning dissertation, tentatively titled "Negotiating Identity in the American Welfare State: The Organizational Origin of Multiracial America."

I am <u>on the job market</u> in the 2024-2025 academic year.

America is a racially hierarchical society. However, ethnic groups with shared experiences of racial discrimination have not always joined forces politically. This book identifies the conditions under which ethnic elites decided to join forces as racial groups by leveraging the case of Asian Americans and Latinos. Before the late 1960s, national origin groups from Asia and Latin America did not come together as Asian Americans and Latinos. Their mobilization strategy shifted during this historical juncture because of the policy changes. Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty programs expanded the American welfare state; however, these new safety net programs were implemented within the existing biracial framework. Street-level bureaucrats faced difficulty in classifying disadvantaged ethnic groups that did not fit into this prevalent image of the minority group. In response, non-target groups solved this collective problem by reinventing and organizing themselves in racial terms. This book traces this origin story by examining the parallel emergence of Asian American and Latino community organizing, which preceded their electoral politics. It also assesses the argument's scope conditions by comparing the variations in interethnic coalition formation in Chinatowns across the U.S. and Canadian border. Finally, it identifies the limitations of this contingent and relational identity formation theory in the contemporary period of racial threats, awakenings, and underlying demographic changes. The American multiracial framework we take for granted today has historical and organizational roots. Managing diversity from the top down is deeply intertwined with mobilizing diversity from the bottom up.

### Teaching and advising

My teaching style is effective because it combines my academic expertise with professional experience. I am an award-winning certified instructor and have taught computational social science in semester-long courses and short workshops. In addition, I have co-authored two articles published in PS: Political Science & Politics on computational social science pedagogy and training. I also wrote an open-access textbook for computational methods titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/comp_thinking_social_science/)

1.  ["Teaching Computational Social Science for All."](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/teaching-computational-social-science-for-all/66EAB886BCF21C647E2387051D6A9BEF) (with Margaret Ng)

2. ["Training Computational Social Science Ph.D. Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers."](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/training-computational-social-science-phd-students-for-academic-and-nonacademic-careers/1455690939833B9FFCAC664D4E412057?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=PSC_Sep23) (with Aniket Kesari, Sono Shah, Taylor Brown, Tiago Ventura, and Tina Law) [[slides](slides/training_css_phd.pdf)] [[website](https://github.com/jaeyk/ic2s2-training-css-tutorial)] (created for the 2024 International Conference for Computational Social Science tutorial)

### Community building

I love learning from other people who share similar research interests and building interdisciplinary communities. I have developed a large and growing network of [collaborators](coauthors.md) across social sciences, data science, engineering, and design. I also have close relationships with several research labs across institutions: Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute's P3 Lab (PI: Hahrie Han), Harvard Kennedy School's Civic Power Lab (PI: Liz McKenna), UCLA's Race, Ethnicity, Politics, & Society (REPS) Lab (PI: Efrén Pérez), and Georgetown McCourt School's Better Government Lab (PI: Donald Moynihan, Pamela Herd, Sebastian Jilke, and Eric Giannella).

I have contributed to expanding the field of computational social science in both the U.S. and South Korea. I co-organized the first partner location of [the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) (SICSS) in [the Bay Area](https://sicss.io/2020/bay_area/) (2020, co-hosted by UC Berkeley and Stanford) and [South Korea](https://sicss.io/2022/korea/) (2022, co-hosted by KAIST and KDI School). I currently serve on [the advisory board of SICSS](https://sicss.io/people). 

I have also served on panels on data science career paths at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2).

### Personal

My career path has been non-linear, spanning academia, public, and private sectors, but my focus has always been on increasing public access to resources. When I was still an undergraduate, I helped Korea University, my alma mater, launch one of the first Massive Open Online Courses in South Korea. Additionally, I was an activist for the Korean branch of Creative Commons, which initiated the Korean open government movement. I also served on the user service advisory board of Naver, the largest internet company in Korea, as its youngest and only college student member. After college, I took my first job as a product manager at a software startup in Seoul. In 2014, I moved to the U.S. for my graduate studies. After earning my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, I did my postdoc training at Johns Hopkins, worked as a tenure-track assistant professor at a policy school in South Korea, and served as a data scientist in the U.S. public sector. I returned to academia to pursue my own intellectual agenda.

As a first-generation immigrant and college student from a working-class family, I am where I am today because of the generous support of my advisors and other mentors. I am committed to giving back by teaching and mentoring students from underserved populations.
