Hello! I am Jae. I am a political scientist by training, a data scientist in practice, and a civic tech nerd at heart.

I am an Assistant Research Scientist at the [SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/), where I co-developed the [Mapping the Modern Agora Project](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/project/mapping-the-modern-agora/). I am also a Research Fellow at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/) and a Fellow at the [Better Government Lab](https://www.fordschool.umich.edu/research/centers/better-government-lab), based at Georgetown University’s McCourt School and University of Michigan’s Ford School. I will join the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill as an Assistant Professor of Public Policy in January 2026.

My research examines how governments and communities build the capacity to implement public policy effectively. I focus on urban, social, and technology policy in the United States—studying how public institutions reduce administrative burdens in safety net programs and how civic infrastructure supports democratic governance.

I use computational and multi-method approaches, including in-depth interviews, archival research, field experiments, surveys, big data analysis, machine learning, and generative AI. I often collaborate with government and nonprofit partners to produce research that directly informs policy and improves practice.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org/programs/), where I collaborated with the U.S. government to improve access to safety net programs. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from UC Berkeley.

I am also a co-founder of the [Data for Good Roundtables](https://sites.google.com/view/d4g-roundtables?usp=sharing), a safe and brave space where academics and practitioners come together to discuss using data for good.

My research has been published in *Nature Human Behaviour*, *Journal of Policy Analysis and Management*, *Nature Scientific Data*, *Perspectives on Politics* \[2x\], *Political Research Quarterly* \[2x\], *Journal of Experimental Political Science*, and *Studies in American Political Development*, among others.

I am the recipient of the Emerging Scholar Award in Civic Engagement (2024) and the Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics (2022) from the American Political Science Association, as well as the Best Paper Award in Asian Pacific American Politics (2020) from the Western Political Science Association.
