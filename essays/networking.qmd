Networking isn’t optional in academia; it’s essential.

I didn’t come to this realization naturally. I’m not someone who thrives
on large social events or group dinners. In fact, I avoided most school
functions as an undergraduate in Korea. I preferred spending time alone:
running outdoors during the day, listening to music, cooking, or reading
at home in the evenings.

In the course of building my career, though, I learned that
opportunities don’t come from effort and talent alone. They come when
your work is known and remembered by people who can open doors. That
only happens if you’re willing to show up, ask questions, and build
relationships. Not once, but again and again.

This isn’t always intuitive, especially for international students or
first-generation scholars. But networking is a skill. It can be learned,
practiced, and improved.

Here are five lessons that helped me, and may help you too.

**1. Define your value**

Academic networking starts before you reach out to anyone. It begins
with understanding what you have to offer and what you’re genuinely
curious about. Before writing to someone, ask: If I were in their
position, why would I want to meet me?

That reflection shapes everything: your message, your tone, even your
questions.

When I email someone I admire, I try to connect my interests to theirs
in a way that’s specific and sincere. Sometimes I point to an overlap in
topics or methods. Sometimes I reference a paper or book of theirs I
found particularly useful. Either way, I do my homework and I make it
easy for them to see why a short meeting could be worthwhile.

A message that shows you’ve engaged with their work, and have something
meaningful to discuss, is far more compelling than a list of
accomplishments.

People are busy. But most are also generous, especially when they can
tell you’ve made the effort to reach out thoughtfully.

**2. Lower the stakes**

Professors are busy. Postdocs and graduate students are too, but faculty
often carry additional institutional responsibilities, including advising students,
writing recommendation letters, and serving on committees.

So keep your messages short. Really short.

Start with one short paragraph explaining why you appreciate their work.
Be specific: a paper you found helpful, a talk that stayed with you, a
project you admire.

Follow with a second paragraph briefly introducing yourself and what
you’re working on, especially if it connects to their interests.

Then close with a third paragraph politely asking if they might have 30
minutes to meet. Keep the tone low-pressure, and frame it as a
conversation rather than a favor.

If they don't respond to you, that's fine. Don’t take it personally.
Sometimes I follow up the next year by saying, "I reached out last time
but didn’t get a chance to connect: I’d still love to talk if you’re
open." That approach has led to some of my most valuable conversations.

**3. Be a service to others**

Networking doesn’t begin or end with asking for advice. Often, the most
durable academic relationships begin when you create value for others.

In 2019, during my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, I attended the Summer Institute
in Computational Social Science at Princeton. The organizers encouraged
participants to help expand the program’s reach. So the following year,
I volunteered to co-organize a new site in the Bay Area, hosted by
Berkeley and Stanford.

That small act, organizing something for others, connected me with dozens
of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students across disciplines. Many of
them have since become coauthors, collaborators, and close colleagues.
It also brought me into contact with Code for America, a civic tech
nonprofit we invited to collaborate. That one encounter eventually led
to a full-time job as a data scientist there. I have so many experiences
like this.

I didn’t think of networking as a way to advance my career. I thought of
it as a way to contribute. Being useful, without expecting anything
back, often does more to build lasting relationships than any
self-serving approach ever could. And usefulness tends to be remembered.

You don’t have to organize a conference to do this. You can offer
feedback on a draft, amplify someone’s work online, or help coordinate a
small reading group. Small contributions often lead to deeper
connections.

**4. Build your board of advisors**

Networking isn’t a one-time push. It’s a lifelong process of
relationship-building. Some people become mentors. Others become
mentees. Some become friends, coauthors, or informal sounding boards.

In the course of building my career, I’ve come to think of this as
building a "personal advisory board." It’s not just about your
dissertation committee. You need different kinds of support at different
stages: people who understand the job market, others who can give
feedback on early-stage ideas, and others who can help you navigate big
career transitions.

And it’s not just reciprocal. You rise higher when you lift others along
the way. The strongest networks are built on shared success, not
competition.

**5. Treat it as a skill, not a trait**

I didn’t grow up thinking I was good at networking. I still don’t love
big receptions or happy hours. But I’ve learned how to build
relationships in ways that feel authentic to me. And that’s the
point. There’s no single right way to do this.

What matters is that you keep showing up, keep learning, and stay open
to connection.

Networking is how opportunities travel. Talent matters. So does timing.
But often, it’s a conversation that turns effort into momentum.

And like any skill, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes.
