I was born and raised in South Korea, lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and have taken a non-linear path through academia, public service, and civic technology. As a first-generation college student from a working-class family, I've written several personal essays reflecting on my career, research, and life—often shaped by questions of purpose, identity, and belonging.
