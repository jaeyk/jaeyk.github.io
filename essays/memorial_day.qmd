Some memories fade as we grow older; others come into sharper focus. As
my late father’s memorial day approaches, one conversation remains
crystal clear: the one I had with him on my wedding day.

It was a few hours before the ceremony. We were sitting side by side in
a hair salon, the stylist adding a final touch to my hair while rain
slid down the window, when he began to speak. He told me, again, how my
grandfather had forbidden him to attend college because, as the youngest
son, he was expected to stay close to home. My father had been so frail
that my grandfather even renamed him *Myungryul*, meaning “long life,”
hoping the new characters would protect him.

He mounted a quiet rebellion, choosing numbers and circuits over rows of
crops and spending thirty-two years as an electrician in a paper mill.
It was one of the few outlets for his talent. In doing so, he escaped
the rural life he was born into, but not the hardships etched into his
path. Factory floors in Korea then were unforgiving: the pounding
machines slowly stole hearing in one ear, and decades of dust and
chemical haze, his likely suspects since he neither smoked nor drank, may
have seeded the cancer that would eventually take his life.

When we talked that rainy morning, I had graduated from college and was
working at a software start-up. Tech circles claimed they would
“revolutionize” the world, while most products really just chased a few
extra ad clicks. The louder the talk grew, the more skeptical I became.
I wanted to answer even a single question properly, and that meant
learning how to do research. Graduate school felt remote to someone from
a working-class family, yet I applied for and received the Korea
Foundation for Advanced Studies scholarship, one of the most prestigious
and competitive fellowships in Korea, awarded that year to only two
political science students to support their PhD studies abroad.

My father was excited about the news and about my marriage to my
girlfriend, a year older and already thriving in an engineering career
he himself might have loved. In us, he saw the opportunities he had once
dreamed of: in me, an education reaching beyond the farm and factory
floor; in her, a career shaped by mathematical skill and a passion for
engineering.

He often said his greatest regret was letting his dream slip away and
that he had no fixed plan for my career, only the hope I would follow my
own path. I remember that conversation not just because of the rain’s
hush, but because it was almost our last real talk. A few months later,
cancer took him.

I moved to the United States and earned a PhD in political science at UC
Berkeley. We hadn’t always seen eye to eye, but I dedicated my
dissertation to him, hoping he might somehow know his sacrifices were
acknowledged. After completing my degree, I began my career as a
researcher and data scientist, always mindful of the path that brought
me here. Today I'm often surrounded by people whose backgrounds rarely
resemble mine, but I've never forgotten my father, our conversation on
that rainy morning, or the dream he was never able to pursue.

It has been more than ten years since he passed away. I can no longer
clearly recall his face or the exact sound of his voice. But I remember
that conversation: the pain I felt, the sorrow I saw, and the regret I
heard. That memory stays with me, sharper than any photograph, and it
shapes the work I do.

Research is powered by curiosity, theory, and data, but for me it is
also anchored in mission. That mission is personal: to stay with the
hard, determined work of adding even a small measure of dignity for
people like my father, people who rarely set foot on a college campus,
who celebrated their children’s chances while quietly carrying the
weight of doors closed to them.

While studying poverty and inequality in the U.S., my adopted home, I
saw their struggles firsthand, spoke with them directly, listened to
their stories, and learned from them, each one a reminder of my father.

Not everyone will sit in university lecture halls, but everyone deserves
research that begins with their lives, listens to their stories,
and, above all, serves them.

<figcaption>My father donated his body to Korea University Medical School (my alma mater). Given that he grew up in a Confucian family, this was both an act of rebellion against his upbringing and a final act of service to others. Whenever I visit South Korea, I make a point to stop by the Korea University campus, not only to catch up with my teachers and friends who are now faculty there, but also to visit my father’s memorial site. It is marked by the Tower of Gratitude (shown in the picture), a monument on the medical campus that hosts the annual Ceremony of Gratitude, held every April to honor body donors who have contributed to the advancement of medicine through their noble sacrifice.
