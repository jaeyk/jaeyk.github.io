I develop open-source software to support data curation and computational research in the social sciences. All packages are freely available on GitHub: [github.com/jaeyk](https://github.com/jaeyk)

1. [**MapAgora**](https://snfagora.github.io/MapAgora/)  
   - **Summary:** An R package for retrieving and processing tax records (e.g., IRS Form 990), website data, and social media handles for U.S. nonprofit organizations. Built to support large-scale analysis of civic infrastructure.  
   - **Use case:** Used in ["The Unequal Landscape of Civic Opportunity in America"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01743-1), *Nature Human Behaviour* (2023), with Milan de Vries and Hahrie Han.  
   - **Collaborator:** Milan de Vries

1. [**autotextclassifier**](https://github.com/snfagora/autotextclassifier)  
   - **Summary:** An R package for automated text classification using the tidymodels framework. Supports supervised learning pipelines with minimal setup for civic tech and policy research applications.  
   - **Use case:** Also used in ["The Unequal Landscape of Civic Opportunity in America"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01743-1), *Nature Human Behaviour* (2023), with Milan de Vries and Hahrie Han.  
   - **Collaborator:** Milan de Vries

1. [**validatednamesr**](https://github.com/jaeyk/validatednamesr)  
   - **Summary:** An R package for accessing and analyzing the validated names dataset used in race and ethnicity experiments. Includes utilities for name filtering, trait inspection, and integration with survey tools.  
   - **Use case:** Featured in ["Validated Names for Experimental Studies on Ethnicity and Race"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01947-0) (*Nature Scientific Data*, 2023) with by Charles Crabtree, S. Michael Gaddis, John B. Holbein, Cameron Guage, and William Marx.
   - **Collaborator:** Charles Crabtree

1. [**tidytweetjson**](https://jaeyk.github.io/tidytweetjson/)  
   - **Summary:** An R package that transforms raw Twitter JSON files into clean, analysis-ready datasets. Useful for studying political discourse, social movements, and real-time reactions to events.  
   - **Use case:** Used in ["COVID-19 and Asian Americans: How Elite Messaging and Social Exclusion Shape Partisan Attitudes"](https://t.co/4Axd0gEQns) *Perspectives on Politics* (2021), with Nathan Chan and Vivien Leung.

1. [**tidyethnicnews**](https://jaeyk.github.io/tidyethnicnews/)  
   - **Summary:** An R package for scraping, cleaning, and organizing ethnic newspaper articles from the Ethnic NewsWatch database. Designed to support media analysis and political communication research.  
   - **Use case:** Used in ["Integrating Human and Machine Coding to Measure Political Issues in Ethnic Newspaper Articles"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-020-00097-2) (*Journal of Computational Social Science* (2021)
