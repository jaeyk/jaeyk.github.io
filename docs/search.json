Simon\n\nHello! I am Jae. I am a political scientist by training, a data scientist in practice, and a civic tech nerd at heart.\nI am an Assistant Research Scientist at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where I co-developed the Mapping the Modern Agora Project. I am also a Research Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and a Fellow at the Better Government Lab, based at Georgetown University‚Äôs McCourt School and University of Michigan‚Äôs Ford School. I will join the University of North Carolina‚ÄìChapel Hill as an Assistant Professor of Public Policy in January 2026.\nMy research examines how governments and communities build the capacity to implement public policy effectively. I focus on urban, social, and technology policy in the United States‚Äîstudying how public institutions reduce administrative burdens in safety net programs and how civic infrastructure supports democratic governance.\nI use computational and multi-method approaches, including in-depth interviews, archival research, field experiments, surveys, big data analysis, machine learning, and generative AI. I often collaborate with government and nonprofit partners to produce research that directly informs policy and improves practice.\nPreviously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Code for America, where I collaborated with the U.S. government to improve access to safety net programs. I earned my Ph.D.¬†in Political Science from UC Berkeley.\nI am also a co-founder of the Data for Good Roundtables, a safe and brave space where academics and practitioners come together to discuss using data for good.\nMy research has been published in Nature Human Behaviour, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Nature Scientific Data, Perspectives on Politics (2x), Political Research Quarterly (2x), Journal of Experimental Political Science, and Studies in American Political Development, among others.\nI am the recipient of the Emerging Scholar Award in Civic Engagement (2024) and the Best Dissertation Award in Urban and Local Politics (2022) from the American Political Science Association, as well as the Best Paper Award in Asian Pacific American Politics (2020) from the Western Political Science Association.\nüìß You can reach me at jkim638@jhu.edu or jaeyeonkim@hks.harvard.edu.\nüìÑ My most recent CV is available at this link.\n\n\nüìÖ 2025 News\n\n\n\nIf I‚Äôm visiting your area and you‚Äôd like to connect‚Äîwhether for collaboration or just conversation‚Äîyou can use the form here.
